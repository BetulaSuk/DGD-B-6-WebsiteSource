        "abstract": "Pristine samples from the lunar highlands potentially offer important information bearing on the nature of early crustal development on all the terrestrial planets. One apparently unique sample of this group of lunar crustal rocks, the feldspathic lherzolite 67667, was studied utilizing the Sm-Nd radiometric system in an attempt to define its age and the implications of that age for the evolution of the lunar highlands. Data for 67667 precisely define an isochron corresponding to an age of 4.18\u00b10.07 AE. The observed lack of disturbance of the Sm-Nd system of this sample may suggest that this time marks its crystallization at shallow depth in the lunar crust. However, the possibility that this age, as well as those of other highland rocks, indicate the time of their impact-induced excavation from regions deep enough in the lunar crust to allow subsolidus isotopic equilibrium to be produced or maintained between their constituent minerals is also considered. Taken together, bulk rock Sm-Nd data for four \u201chigh-Mg\u201d rocks, including 67667, indicate that the chemical characteristics of all their source materials were established 4.33\u00b10.08 AE ago and were intimately associated with the parent materials of KREEP. This finding provides more support for the concept of a large-scale differentiation episode early in lunar history. The possible roles of the crystallization of a global magma ocean, endogenous igneous activity, and of planetesimal impact, in producing the observed geochemical and chronological aspects of lunar highland rocks are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Strontium and carbon isotopes of marine carbonates are routinely applied for chemostratigraphic cross correlations of time-equivalent sedimentary sequences and for calibration of the compositional evolution of seawater throughout Earth's history, mainly for the purpose of reconstructing ancient climatic changes. We here present results of a new isotopic tracer system \u2013 stable chromium isotopes \u2013 applied to a late Ediacaran marine carbonate sequence exposed in the Calera de Recalde syncline, Arroyo del Soldado Group, Uruguay. The aim was to compare Cr isotope signatures directly to \u03b4C, Sr/Sr and Nd/Nd fluctuations in a well defined stratigraphic profile comprising sediments that were deposited during cold\u2013warm periods accompanied by sea-level changes in response to glaciation\u2013deglaciation at higher latitudes. The studied section is characterized by a pronounced negative (down to \u2212 3.3\u2030) \u03b4C excursion in carbonates paralleled by a decrease of Sr/Sr values. Chromium isotope signatures over this section also show a correlated decrease in \u03b4Cr (\u03b4Cr = [((Cr/Cr) / (Cr/Cr)) \u2212 1] \u00d7 1000) values from ~+0.29 to \u2212 0.17\u2030 which mirrors a decrease in positively fractioned seawater signatures to slightly negative values characteristic of high-temperature magmatic sources. Linear correlations between \u03b4Cr and \u03b5Nd(570 Ma), Sr/Sr and Cr concentrations can be explained by mixing between two major input sources of Cr, Nd and Sr into the shallow seawater: 1) a source characterized by negative \u03b4Cr values of ~\u22120.2\u2030 , low Sr/Sr values of ~ 0.707, and elevated Sm/Nd values of ~ 0.13, recognized as a subaqueous hydrothermal dominated input source, and 2) a source characterized by positively fractionated \u03b4Cr values of ~+0.2\u2030, higher Sr/Sr values of ~ 0.708, and lower Sm/Nd values of ~ 0.11, a source which is strongly affected by continentally derived input. Chromium isotopes provide a powerful tool for reconstructing the redox state of ancient seawater since positive values indicate that, at least locally, Neoproterozoic shallow ocean waters were sufficiently oxidized to fractionate chromium and/or that oxygen levels of the atmosphere were sufficient to transform Cr(III) into the more mobile hexavalent Cr(VI) formed during weathering processes on land.The fact that Sr/Sr values, despite \u03b4C fluctuations, remain low (indicative of a strong hydrothermal input into the basin at his time) implies that CO limitation was the cause of negative \u03b4C and \u03b4Cr excursions in otherwise nutrient rich late Neoproterozoic basins, and that glaciation is only one more consequence of a tectonically driven, biologically mediated system. In such a scenario, glaciation acts as an amplifier of \u03b4Cr signals. These signals in marine carbonates are a sensitive tracer for redox processes in the ocean and/or on land and have the potential to contribute significantly, in combination with the other commonly used isotopic tracers, to the reconstruction of climatic changes, particularly those that are associated with major glaciation periods in Earth's history.\u25ba Systematic Cr isotope record over a Late Ediacaran negative \u03b4C excursion. \u25ba Covariations between Sr, Nd and Cr isotopes imply a two source mixing. \u25ba Mirroring of the \u03b4C excursion by \u03b4Cr reflects changes in bioproductivity. \u25ba Cr isotopes in marine carbonates potentially monitor atmospheric fluctuations.",

It is situated within the Eocene-Oligocene volcanic-plutonic belt of the Tarom subzone of the Alborz mountains range. Quartz monzonite and tuffs are the main host rock of the Lubin-Zardeh Au-Cu \u00b1 Pb \u00b1 Zn deposit. Granitoid rocks are predominantly high- K, calc-alkaline with shoshonitic affinities. They are I-type, metaluminous, magnesian and are characterized by LILE, LREE and Th enrichment relative to HFSE, depletion in Nb, Ta, Ti and weak depletion in HREE and Y. These granitoids show some affinities with adakites, e.g., high Sr/Y and La/Yb ratios coupled with low Yb and Y, and enrichment in LREE and LILE with weak Eu anomalies. Their relatively low to moderate initial Sr/Sr values (0.7047\u20130.7051), positive Nd (t = 36 Ma) values (0.39\u20132.1) and TDM ages of 0.69 to 1.06 Ga, with Pb isotopic ratios of initial Pb/Pb = 18.49\u201318.68, initial Pb/Pb = 15.58\u201315.61 and initial Pb/Pb = 38.33\u201338.77, are consistent with a phlogopite-bearing, amphibole-rich, and enriched lithospheric mantle source metasomatized by earlier subducted sediments.

        "abstract": "Major and trace element compositions and Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd relations are presented for a series of 290\u2013300 Ma old basaltic lavas (B) from Vestfold and for the single B flow at Krokskogen in the Permo-Carboniferous Oslo Rift. The Vestfold sequence consists of subalkaline to alkaline basalts, potassic trachybasalts and shoshonites. At Krokskogen B is a subalkaline basalt. The Vestfold basaltic lavas show a relatively wide range in trace element concentrations, and Ta-enriched trace element abundance patterns. Ratios between pairs of incompatible elements show small, but significant variations e.g., Th/Ta: 1.2-1.8. The highest Th/Ta (2.1) is found in the Krokskogen basalt. A Th/Ta of 1.2 is typical of MORB and OIB, whereas the ratio 1.8 is typical of the lower crust. This variation in Th/Ta is not linked to trace element concentrations, but is accompanied by a regular shift in age-corrected , and from + 4.1, \u221210 and +19.2 to \u22121, +18 and +17.7, respectively.The observed variations in incompatible element ratios, initial isotopic ratios and trace element concentrations are interpreted as follows: The basaltic magmas which gave rise to the Vestfold and Krokskogen lavas originated in lithospheric mantle, which was mildly depleted with respect to Nd-Sr isotopic ratios but relatively rich in radiogenic Pb (PREMA-type). These magmas were retained in the lower crust where they crystallized ol + cpx; some of the magmas were also contaminated. The highest degree of contamination is seen in the lower part of the Vestfold sequence and in the Krokskogen basalt. At the present level of information about the Oslo Rift (no data are available for its southern, submerged part), rift magmatism appears to be dominated by a PREMA source in the pre-rift lower lithosphere. The dominance of a lithospheric mantle source in the rift magmatism suggests that the Oslo rifting event was initiated by passive mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Isotopic dating of detrital zircon populations from metasediments and of magmatic zircon from intercalated metavolcanic layers in the medium- to high-grade part of the Kaoko Belt in Namibia provides first robust constraints on the age of Neoproterozoic sedimentation along the southwestern margin of the Congo Craton. Dating of detrital zircons from metasediments directly overlying the cratonic basement shows maximum sedimentary ages of c. 1.00 and c. 1.45 Ga, and age populations comparable with known protolith ages from the gneisses of the Congo/Kalahari cratons. Dating of zircon from associated metavolcanics constrains the age of the earliest preserved sediments at c. 740\u2013710 Ma.Detrital zircon populations from the samples collected from the upper parts of the metasedimentary succession contain only small proportion of grains with ages similar to those from the Congo Craton. These samples show dominance of c. 1.00 Ga, c. 750 Ma and c. 650 Ma old zircon grains that are probably derived from the Punta del Este \u2013 Coastal Terrane (Dom Feliciano and Kaoko belts) that acted as an arc/back-arc domain at c. 650\u2013630 Ma. Neodymium model ages for the samples of metasedimentary cover of the cratonic basement provide another evidence that the youngest preserved sediments could not have been derived from the Congo Craton.Recognition of the Punta del Este \u2013 Coastal Terrane crust as a source region for the youngest pre-collisional sediments of the Kaoko Belt suggests that this terrane must have been in close proximity to the Congo Craton passive margin already some time prior to their mutual collision at c. 570\u2013550 Ma. This is in accord with an interpretation that the c. 650\u2013630 Ma arc/back-arc Punta del Este \u2013 Coastal Terrane has developed directly on top of, or very close to, the attenuated Congo Craton passive margin.",

        "abstract": "The Dehsalm Cu\u2013Mo-bearing porphyritic granitoids belong to the Lut Block volcanic\u2013plutonic belt (central eastern Iran). These rocks range in composition from gabbro-diorite to granite, with dominance of monzonites and quartz monzonites, and have geochemical features of high-K calc-alkaline to shoshonitic volcanic arc suites. Primitive mantle-normalized trace element spider diagrams display strong enrichment in large-ion lithophile elements such as Rb, Ba and Cs and depletions in some high-field strength elements, e.g., Nb, Ti, Y and HREE. Chondrite-normalized plots display significant LREE enrichments, high LaN/YbN and a lack of Eu anomaly. High Sr/Y and La/Yb ratios of Dehsalm intrusives reveal that, despite their K-rich composition, these granitoids show some resemblances with adakitic rocks. A Rb\u2013Sr whole rock\u2013feldspar\u2013biotite age of 33 \u00b1 1 Ma was obtained in a quartz monzonite sample and coincides, within error, with a previous geochronological result in Chah-Shaljami granitoids, further northwest within the Lut Block. (87Sr/86Sr)i and \u03b5Ndi isotopic ratios range from 0.70481 to 0.70508 and from +1.5 to +2.5, respectively, which fits into a supra-subduction mantle wedge source for the parental melts and indicates that crustal contribution for magma diversification was of limited importance. Sr and Nd isotopic compositions together with major and trace element geochemistry point to an origin of the parental magmas by melting of a metasomatized mantle source, with phlogopite breakdown playing a significant role in the geochemical fingerprints of the parental magmas; small amounts of residual garnet in the mantle source also help to explain some trace element patterns. Geochemical features of Dehsalm porphyries and its association with Cu\u2013Mo mineralization agree with a mature continental arc setting related to the convergence of Afghan and Lut plates during Oligocene.",

        "abstract": "Pre-Variscan mantle derived gabbros (c. 400 Ma) and late-Variscan calc-alkaline lamprophyres (c. 330 Ma) were emplaced within the Cadomian basement of Lusatia. They were sampled to characterize the effect of the Variscan orogeny onto the mantle beneath Lusatia. The tholeiitic gabbros originated from a mantle source that had been metasomatized during subduction beneath the Cadomian magmatic arc at c. 570 Ma, which led to enrichment of LREE, Ba/Nb, and LILE relative to primitive mantle. The late-Variscan calc-alkaline lamprophyres (spessartites) have high MgO, Cr, and Ni contents reflecting the mantle source. The spessartites, however, have distinctly higher Rb, Ba, Pb, Sr, Th, and Cs contents, higher La/Yb, Sr/Sr, and Pb/Pb ratios, and lower Nd/Nd ratios than the gabbros, which indicates a second, Variscan event of mantle enrichment. In addition, the spessartites have trace element ratios (i.e., Ba/Nb, Nb/U, Th/U, and Th/Nb) that resemble continental crust and Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic compositions that demonstrate involvement of crustal material by source enrichment during the Variscan orogeny. The calc-alkaline lamprophyres of the Lusatia occupy the same age range as calc-alkaline lamprophyres from the adjacent Erzgebirge and Sudetes. The trace-element signatures and Sr and Nd isotopic compositions of Lusatian spessartites, however, are less enriched than those of comparable dikes in the Sudetes and the Erzgebirge. This implies that the Variscan orogeny resulted in geochemically and isotopically heterogeneous lithospheric mantle on the regional scale, possibly reflecting the contrasting nature of the subducted rocks.\u25ba Ar\u2013Ar hornblende age for calc-alkaline lamprophyres in Lusatia. \u25ba Tholeiitic gabbro and lamprophyre from a repeatedly enriched mantle source. \u25ba Regionally variably enriched mantle beneath the Variscan orogen.",

        "abstract": "Major and trace element compositions and Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd relations are presented for a series of 290\u2013300 Ma old basaltic lavas (B) from Vestfold and for the single B flow at Krokskogen in the Permo-Carboniferous Oslo Rift. The Vestfold sequence consists of subalkaline to alkaline basalts, potassic trachybasalts and shoshonites. At Krokskogen B is a subalkaline basalt. The Vestfold basaltic lavas show a relatively wide range in trace element concentrations, and Ta-enriched trace element abundance patterns. Ratios between pairs of incompatible elements show small, but significant variations e.g., Th/Ta: 1.2-1.8. The highest Th/Ta (2.1) is found in the Krokskogen basalt. A Th/Ta of 1.2 is typical of MORB and OIB, whereas the ratio 1.8 is typical of the lower crust. This variation in Th/Ta is not linked to trace element concentrations, but is accompanied by a regular shift in age-corrected , and from + 4.1, \u221210 and +19.2 to \u22121, +18 and +17.7, respectively.The observed variations in incompatible element ratios, initial isotopic ratios and trace element concentrations are interpreted as follows: The basaltic magmas which gave rise to the Vestfold and Krokskogen lavas originated in lithospheric mantle, which was mildly depleted with respect to Nd-Sr isotopic ratios but relatively rich in radiogenic Pb (PREMA-type). These magmas were retained in the lower crust where they crystallized ol + cpx; some of the magmas were also contaminated. The highest degree of contamination is seen in the lower part of the Vestfold sequence and in the Krokskogen basalt. At the present level of information about the Oslo Rift (no data are available for its southern, submerged part), rift magmatism appears to be dominated by a PREMA source in the pre-rift lower lithosphere. The dominance of a lithospheric mantle source in the rift magmatism suggests that the Oslo rifting event was initiated by passive mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "In the central-southern region of Esp\u00edrito Santo State, southeastern Brazil, several granitoids with a variable composition intruded high-grade metamorphic rocks, in the northern segment of the Ribeira fold belt. A close relationship between hydrous and anhydrous facies is present in some of the plutons, including the Varzea Alegre Igneous Complex, which has an inner domain formed by gabbro, diorite and granite, and an irregular outer ring of charnockitic rocks. These green megaporphyritic charnockites have primary anhydrous mineral assemblage, I-type and metaluminous character, and high-K calc-alkaline signature. U-Pb zircon single crystal ages obtained by TIMS indicate crystallization at about 500 Ma, similar to other late tectonic plutons of this part of the Ribeira belt. Sr and Nd isotopic ratios ranging from 0.7078 to 0.7096 and 0.5114 to 0.5116 respectively, are interpreted to be indicative of a hybrid origin from crustal and mantle-derived magmas. A binary diagram using Sr isotope ratios also demonstrates that the genesis of the charnockites probably included both magma mixing and fractional crystallization processes.",

        "abstract": "Numerous Permian granitic intrusions (plutons) in the Panxi region, SW China are spatially and temporally associated with the Emeishan large igneous province (ELIP). Granites from the 260 Ma Panzhihua and Taihe plutons are peralkaline (ASI = 0.76\u20131.12; Na + K/Al = 0.78\u20131.2) and have high Fe values (0.92\u20130.99) with negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu = 0.22\u20130.98). Contrasted with the peralkaline plutons, syenites from the 260 Ma Woshui pluton are metaluminous (ASI = 0.84\u20131.0; Na + K/Al = 0.91\u20131.01) and have moderately high Fe (0.79\u20130.81) and positive Eu-anomalies (Eu/Eu = 0.82\u20131.91). Both the peralkaline and metaluminous rocks have mantle isotopic signatures (\u03b5Nd = + 1.3\u2013+ 3.2) and were derived from the ELIP mantle plume source. The peralkaline rocks were likely derived by fractional crystallization of the temporally, spatially and chemically associated layered mafic intrusions which host giant magmatic Fe-Ti-V oxide deposits. The metaluminous granitic rocks, although spatially related to the peralkaline granites and layered gabbros were likely generated by partial melting of underplated mafic rocks. Granites from the 251 Ma Ailanghe pluton are peraluminous (ASI = 0.97\u20131.29) and have high Fe (0.82\u20130.91) values and negative Eu-anomalies (Eu/Eu = 0.10\u20130.37). Their crustal isotopic signature (\u03b5Nd = \u2212 5.7 to \u2212 6.7) indicates possible derivation from melting of Yangtze Block basement rocks. The Ailanghe pluton is contemporaneous with other A-type granites in the region, supporting the view that ELIP magmatism was sporadic for at least 9 million years. The coexistence of three chemically exclusive A-type granites in the ELIP suggests that a variety of A-type granites can be generated in the same tectonic setting.",

        "abstract": "Granulite enclaves as an indicator that can be used to unravel multistage metamorphic histories of orogenic belts have attracted a lot of attention. Few exposed granulite enclaves, however, form restite-melt pairs with their host rocks, which provide unique insight into magma source character and conditions of partial melting. In this study, the orthopyroxene- and plagioclase-rich and the garnet-rich and plagioclase-poor restitic granulite enclaves hosted by three peraluminous granitic plutons from South China were characterized. Mineral assemblages, mineral compositions, pressure-temperature pseudosection modeling, and zircon U-Pb data for the two types of restitic enclaves reveal that (1) an early (255\u2013249 Ma) melting event occurred at conditions of \u223c950 \u00b1 30 \u00b0C and \u223c500 \u00b1 80 MPa, and (2) a later (245\u2013246 Ma) melting event occurred at conditions of \u223c905 \u00b1 15 \u00b0C and \u223c675 \u00b1 25 MPa. The crustal magma source is inferred to have rapidly (within 3\u201310 m.y.) migrated from mid- to deep-crustal levels from \u223c18 to \u223c25 km (for an average crustal density of 2.7 g/cm3), with burial rates of 0.07\u20130.23 cm yr\u20131, in response to a switch in the geodynamic regime from subduction to continent-continent collision. Whole-rock elemental and isotopic compositions of enclaves and granitic rocks further indicate that partial melting in the source was nonmodal. The key implications from our findings are that magma sources may migrate over the lifetime of many composite, upper-crustal intrusions, and that compositional variation in intrusive suites may reflect source partial melting at various pressures in addition to other factors.",

        "abstract": "Tholeiites occur in a variety of geological settings, e.g., mid-ocean ridge, back-arc basin, ocean island, island arc and intra-continent, and their geochemical and isotopic characteristics vary according to the corresponding geodynamic environments. Here we investigated the Hatu tholeiitic basalts and basaltic andesites of the western Junggar region, Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). LA-ICPMS zircon U\u2013Pb analyses indicate that the Hatu tholeiites were generated in the Late Carboniferous (~ 315 Ma). All the studied rock samples are characterized by flat rare earth elements pattern on chondrite-normalized plot, and negligible Nb, Ta and Ti anomalies on mid-ocean-ridge basalt normalized plots. They are also characterized by moderate positive \u03b5(t) (+ 5.25 to + 5.94), \u03b5(t) (+ 13.24 to + 14.89), highly radiogenic Os isotope compositions (Os/Os = 0.1338\u20130.3547), and relatively low (Sr/Sr) ratios (0.7044 to 0.7048). Taking into account their geological characteristics, the occurrence of nearby ophiolites and the types of contemporaneous magmatic rocks found in the western Junggar region, we propose that the Hatu basalts were generated by slab window-related processes following a spreading ridge subduction beneath the Keramay intra-oceanic island arc. During this process, deep and enriched asthenospheric mantle rose to the edge of the subducted oceanic lithosphere, its melts infiltrating the subducted oceanic lithosphere and reacting with peridotites. Therefore, the Hatu tholeiites are interpreted as a result of melting of a mixed mantle source consisting of subducted depleted oceanic lithosphere and a deep, enriched upwelling asthenospheric mantle. Incongruent dynamic melting modeling of trace element compositions indicates that the Hatu basalts could have been derived from large degrees of melting (~ 10%) of such a mixed mantle source. This newly recognized mechanism is a natural consequence of the diversity of contemporaneous potential mantle sources available in slab window settings.\u25ba ~ 315 Ma Hatu tholeiitic basalts were associated with ridge subduction. \u25ba Asthenosphere-derived melts infiltrated subducted oceanic lithosphere. \u25ba Mixing between subducted oceanic lithosphere and enriched asthenosphere. \u25ba Diverse potential mantle sources for basalts are available in slab window settings.",

        "abstract": "On Earth, chemical weathering of basaltic rocks not only modulates the climate change, but also plays a crucial role on the ocean oxygenation and ecosystem evolution. Records of paleo-weathered crusts are a challenge to identify because they are obscured by subsequent alteration processes and buried by the newly formed volcanic lavas. However, late formed volcanic rocks theoretically could record previously weathered crust via their assimilation and fractional crystallization (AFC) processes. Here, we present a systematic study on major, trace elements and Sr-Nd-Mg isotopes in a suite of Changbaishan early formed basalts and late erupted trachytes from Northeast China. Detailed evidence of field observation, geochemical signature and rhyolite-MELTS simulations suggest that trachytes mainly originated from deep fractional crystallization of basaltic melts. The low abundant trachytes from the stratigraphic layer above the basalts display decoupled MgSr and Nd isotopes. \u03b4Mg and Sr/Sr in trachytes range from \u22120.27 up to +0.94\u2030 (the heaviest isotopic composition ever reported for Mg in the igneous rocks) and 0.70490 to 0.71065, respectively, which are significantly elevated relative to that of their mantle source. However, they preserved mantle source-like Nd/Nd (0.512584 to 0.512656) ratios. These unusual characteristics cannot be explained by thermal diffusion, fractional crystallization or simple crustal contamination processes. Specifically, \u03b4Mg correlates positively with SiO and Sr/Sr, and negatively with MgO, CaO, AlO, Sr and Nb/U indicators. The highly elevated Mg and Sr isotopes but limited Nd isotopic changes in trachytes require a component to be the relatively younger weathering residue of basaltic rocks. Taking this component as a wall rock endmember, the well-developed above correlations can be best modelled by AFC processes. This reflects that some trachytes in the aftermath of AFC processes almost fully lost their primary source characteristics, but inherited the intense chemical weathering signature of basalts. This event probably occurred in the middle Miocene as studies of paleosols showed humid and warm climate during that period after the initial eruption of Changbaishan basalts. Therefore, our study as a specific case for the first time provides an efficient way to explore paleo-weathering of basaltic crusts buried in the Earth's surface, through comprehensive investigating Mg, Sr and Nd isotopes of volcanic rocks developed in the late stage of a volcano cone.",

        "abstract": "Basaltic trachyandesites and trachyandesites from the northern North China Craton (NCC) provide an excellent opportunity to examine the nature of their mantle source and the secular evolution of the underlying mantle lithosphere. In addition, our study of these rocks helps to constrain the age and mechanism of NCC lithospheric destruction. In this paper, we report geochronological, geochemical, and Sr\u2013Nd isotopic analyses of the Niujiaogou (NJG) basaltic trachyandesites and trachyandesites. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) zircon U\u2013Pb dating yielded an age of 120.7 \u00b1 0.8 million years, which we regard as the crystallization age of the rocks. Analysed whole-rock samples are enriched in both light rare earth elements and large ion lithophile elements (i.e. Rb, Sr and Ba), but depleted in heavy rare earth elements and high field strength elements (i.e. Nb, Ta, and Ti), with slightly negative to positive Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu = 0.73\u20131.09). The NJG basaltic trachyandesites and trachyandesites are characterized by low MgO (2.42\u20133.69 wt.%), Cr (10.3\u201324.6 ppm) and Ni (17.1\u201325.6 ppm), suggesting that they may have originated from an extremely evolved magma. In addition, the rocks display negative () values (\u221212.2 to \u22128.5), which indicate that they were derived from a common lithosphere mantle that had previously been metasomatized by fluids related to subduction of Paleo-Asian Ocean sedimentary units. This magmatism may have been induced by large-scale, transtensional strike-slip on the Tan-Lu fault zone. In accord with earlier studies, these findings provide evidence that the lithospheric mantle source beneath western Liaoning Province was not changed much by the extensive Mesozoic magmatism during Triassic to early Cretaceous time.",

        "abstract": ", , trace and major element results are reported for Cenozoic alkaline basalts and associated tholeiitic basalts from southwestern Japan, and some from Korea and China. Most of the samples plot within the mantle array with values ranging from +5.0 to \u22123.2 and ratios ranging from 0.7037 to 0.7057.The isotopic variations observed along traverse sections of alkaline basalts from the trench to the continental sides of southwestern Japan do not suggest a direct relationship between the subduction of the Philippine Sea and Pacific plates, and the generation of alkaline basalt magmas. However, in southwestern Japan the alkaline basalts do show evidence of a subducted component and are more enriched in the mobile incompatible elements, such as Rb, Ba and K, relative to Chinese and Korean basalts.Negative correlations between and Sm/Nd and between and La/Th, as well as a positive correlation between and La/Th, are recognized in some of the basalts. These relationships indicate at least two-component magma mixing between (1) magma resulting from a small melting from a depleted mantle and (2) magma resulting from a relatively large amount of melting of an enriched mantle source. It is suggested that the Cenozoic alkaline basalts from southwestern Japan, Korea and China are product of interaction between a MORB-type mantle and a deep mantle plume.If the mantle plume has ascended from the upper mantle-lower mantle or core-mantle boundary, the subducted Pacific and Philippine Sea plates could not have extended to southwestern Japan. Had they done so they would have arrested, before they reached the melting zone, the ascent of the plumes that produced the alkaline volcanism in southwestern Japan.",

        "abstract": "Molybdenum isotope variations in mafic arc lavas have mainly been attributed to the influence of slab-derived components, such as subducted sediment melts and aqueous fluids. The latter have been hypothesised to fractionate Mo isotopes through interaction with the oceanic crust and carry an isotopically heavy signal that is transferred to the source of arc magmas. Thus, understanding Mo isotope systematics in subduction zones requires characterising the Mo isotope composition of slab-derived fluids and their influence on the Mo isotope budget of arc magmas. However, Mo isotope data reported to date show a considerable influence from subducted sediments that complicate accurate constraints being placed on the fluid contribution. We present Mo isotope data for mafic lavas from the Izu arc, a highly depleted oceanic island arc whose magma compositions show a dominant control from slab-derived fluids. The lavas from the Izu volcanic front are isotopically heavier than MORB and the depleted mantle. Their \u03b4Mo (the relative difference in measured Mo/Mo to NIST 3134) systematically varies with indicators for fluid-mobile element enrichment, suggesting that slab-derived fluids in the Izu arc have heavy Mo isotope compositions. Additionally, co-variations with radiogenic Nd/Nd and Hf/Hf point to a relationship between the addition of aqueous fluids and compositional heterogeneity of the sub-arc mantle. We present mass balance models that show that the influence of subduction zone fluids on the trace element pattern of arc magmas is more dominant when these are added to a more depleted and refractory sub-arc mantle, which preferentially melts due to a relatively higher fluid flux. The mass balance of Mo in the Izu arc predicts a light Mo isotope composition for the residual oceanic crust as a result of the preferential removal of isotopically heavy Mo during slab dehydration, consistent with previous suggestions for the Mariana arc and isotopically light Mo previously reported for eclogites.",

        "abstract": "Late Jurassic dioritic plutons from the Bristol Lake region of the eastern Mojave Desert share several geochemical attributes with high-alumina basalts, continental hawaiite basalts, and high-K are andesites including: high K2O concentrations; high Al2O3 (16\u201319 weight %); elevated Zr/TiO2; LREE (light-rare-earth-element) enrichment (La/YbCN=6.3\u201313.3); and high Nb. Pearce element ratio analysis supported by petrographic relations demonstrates that P, Hf, and Zr were conserved during differentiation. Abundances of conserved elements suggest that dioritic plutons from neighboring ranges were derived from similar parental melts. In the most voluminous suite, correlated variations in elemental concentrations and (87Sr/86Sr)i indicate differentiation by fractional crystallization of hornblende and plagioclase combined with assimilation of a component characterized by abundant radiogenic Sr. Levenberg-Marquardt and Monte Carlo techniques were used to obtain optimal solutions to non-linear inverse models for fractional crystallization-assimilation processes. Results show that the assimilated material was chemically analogous to lower crustal mafic granulites and that the mass ratio of contaminant to parental magma was on the order of 0.1. Lack of enrichment in 18O with differentiation is consistent with the model results. Elemental concentrations and O, Sr, and Nd isotopic data point to a hydrous REE-enriched subcontinental lithospheric source similar to that which produced some Cenozoic continental hawaiites from the southern Cordillera. Isotopic compositions of associated granitoids suggest that partial melting of this subcontinental lithosphere may have been an important process in the development of the Late Jurassic plutonic arc of the eastern Mojave Desert.",

        "abstract": "The Late Cretaceous Catal\u00e3o I carbonatite complex consists of ultramafic silicate rocks, phoscorites, nelsonites and carbonatites. The latest stages of the evolution of the complex are characterized by several nelsonite (magnetite\u2013apatite rock) and carbonatite dykes, plugs and veins crosscutting earlier alkaline rocks. The interaction between the latter and late-stage carbonatites and/or carbo-hydrothermal fluids, converted the original dunites and bebedourites to metasomatic phlogopitites. Late-stage nelsonites (N1), pseudonelsonites (N2) and various types of dolomite carbonatites (DC) including norsethite-, magnesite- and/or monazite-bearing varieties show significant whole-rock Nd and Sr isotopic variations. To elucidate whether magmatic or metasomatic processes, or both, were responsible for these isotope variations we characterized the Nd and Sr isotope compositions of major mineral phases (i.e. apatite, dolomite, norsethite, pyrochlore and tetraferriphlogopite) in these late-stage rocks. Mineral isotope data recorded the same differences observed between N1 and N2 whole-rocks with N2 minerals showing more enriched isotopic signatures than minerals from N1. Sr isotopic disequilibrium among minerals from N2 pseudonelsonites and spatially related dolomite carbonatite pockets implies formation from batches of carbonate melts with distinct isotopic compositions. A detailed investigation of Nd and Sr isotopes from whole-rocks and minerals suggests that the most evolved rocks of the Catal\u00e3o I complex probably derive from two different evolution paths. We propose that an earlier magmatic trend (path A) could be explained by several batches of immiscible and/or residual melts derived from carbonated-silicate parental magma (e.g. phlogopite picrite) contaminated with continental crust to a variable extent, in an AFCLI-like process. A second trend (path B) comprises highly variable Nd/Nd at nearly constant Sr/Sr coupled with high \u03b4O in carbonates. This is interpreted here as the result of the interaction of previously-formed dolomite carbonatites with carbo-hydrothermal fluids.",

        "abstract": "Granulite enclaves as an indicator that can be used to unravel multistage metamorphic histories of orogenic belts have attracted a lot of attention. Few exposed granulite enclaves, however, form restite-melt pairs with their host rocks, which provide unique insight into magma source character and conditions of partial melting. In this study, the orthopyroxene- and plagioclase-rich and the garnet-rich and plagioclase-poor restitic granulite enclaves hosted by three peraluminous granitic plutons from South China were characterized. Mineral assemblages, mineral compositions, pressure-temperature pseudosection modeling, and zircon U-Pb data for the two types of restitic enclaves reveal that (1) an early (255\u2013249 Ma) melting event occurred at conditions of \u223c950 \u00b1 30 \u00b0C and \u223c500 \u00b1 80 MPa, and (2) a later (245\u2013246 Ma) melting event occurred at conditions of \u223c905 \u00b1 15 \u00b0C and \u223c675 \u00b1 25 MPa. The crustal magma source is inferred to have rapidly (within 3\u201310 m.y.) migrated from mid- to deep-crustal levels from \u223c18 to \u223c25 km (for an average crustal density of 2.7 g/cm3), with burial rates of 0.07\u20130.23 cm yr\u20131, in response to a switch in the geodynamic regime from subduction to continent-continent collision. Whole-rock elemental and isotopic compositions of enclaves and granitic rocks further indicate that partial melting in the source was nonmodal. The key implications from our findings are that magma sources may migrate over the lifetime of many composite, upper-crustal intrusions, and that compositional variation in intrusive suites may reflect source partial melting at various pressures in addition to other factors.",

        "abstract": "The past \u223c25 m.y. of geologic history in the northern \u223c300 km (\u223c33\u00b0\u201336\u00b0S) of the Andean Southern Volcanic Zone has seen waxing and waning magmatic production rates and episodic eastward relocation of arc segments accompanied by abrupt chemical changes in the magmas. These changes can be linked to episodes of crustal thickening at times of backarc thrusting and to peaks of subduction erosion of forearc crust and mantle lithosphere at times of frontal-arc migration to the east. The magmatictectonic coupling is well seen in the history\u2014enhanced by 28 new K-Ar ages, >160 major and trace element analyses, and Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope analyses\u2014of a west to east transect through the El Teniente copper district near 34\u00b0S. The temporal trends in magmatic chemistry in this transect are like the well-documented south to north trends in Pleistocene to Holocene volcanic centers of the Southern Volcanic Zone, and both can be linked to the same events. The magmatic changes require differences in magma source regions as shown by isotopic data and in depths of crustal magma generation/fractionation as shown by pressure-sensitive trace element distributions. \u201cAdakitic\u201d magmas in the region are attributed to a combination of melting the base of thickened lower crust and crust entering the mantle through subduction erosion. Subduction erosion is argued to peak in episodes of frontal-arc migration at ca. 19\u201316 Ma and ca. 7\u20134 Ma. The combined effects of crustal shortening and forearc truncation in the past 20 m.y. near 34\u00b0S have led to the loss of \u223c170 km of crustal width. The timing and arc length over which these events occurred show that subduction of the Juan Ferna\u0301ndez Ridge on the Nazca plate cannot have been the major driving force. The history of the region shows the importance of non-steady-state processes in arc-magma production and the necessity of studying arc systems over millions, not tens of thousands, of years.",

        "abstract": "Interaction of magma with wall rock is an important process in igneous petrology, but the mechanisms by which interactions occur are poorly known. The western outer granodiorite of the Cretaceous Tuolumne Intrusive Suite of Yosemite National Park, California, intruded a variety of metasedimentary and igneous wall rocks at 93.1 Ma. The May Lake metamorphic screen is a metasedimentary remnant whose contact zone exhibits a variety of interaction phenomena including xenolith incorporation, disaggregation, and partial melting. The chemical contrast of these metasedimentary rocks with the invading pluton provides an excellent measure of pluton/wall rock interactions. Wall rock xenoliths (mostly pelitic quartzite) are predominantly located in an elongate horizon surrounded by a hybridized fine-grained granodiorite. Initial Sr and Nd isotopic ratios of the hybridized granodiorite indicate significant local incorporation of crustal material. Major- and trace-element geochemical data indicate that contamination of the granodiorite occurred via selective assimilation of both high-K and low-K, high-silica partial melts derived from pelitic quartzite. Although the hybridized granodiorite shows significant amounts of contamination, adjacent to xenoliths the proportion of contamination is undetectable more than a meter away. These results indicate that the chemical and isotopic variability of the Tuolumne Intrusive Suite is not caused by magma contamination via in situ wall rock assimilation.",

        "abstract": "The processes of magma generation in upwelling eclogite bodies of recycled lithospheric material are not fully understood but are important for our understanding and modelling of major and trace element variations in many ocean island basalts (OIB). The primitive alkaline intraplate basalts from the Payenia volcanic province (34\u201338 \u00b0S) in Argentina, for which Sr, Nd and double-spike Pb isotope ratios are presented, and from other north Patagonian volcanic fields may provide details of the eclogite melt\u2013peridotite reactions taking place in the melting column of an upwelling OIB-type mantle. The isotopic composition of the uncontaminated lavas is highly restricted but the Payenia basalts fall in two distinct trace element groups termed the high and low Nb/U groups, which both have EM1-type trace element patterns but with subtle differences that cannot be explained by contamination, fractionation or simple variations in degrees of mantle melting. The difference is also clear in major elements where the low Nb/U basalts have markedly higher alkali contents but lower FeO and Ni than the high Nb/U basalts. Four melt components have been identified based on olivine fractionation corrected compositions: a low Nb/U pyroxenite melt component which is interpreted as an eclogite melt that experienced low degrees of melt\u2013peridotite interaction, a high Nb/U pyroxenite melt component which is interpreted as an eclogite melt that experienced high degrees of melt\u2013peridotite interaction, a low pressure peridotite melt component which contributes to most high Nb/U, Pay\u00fan Matr\u00fa, Matancilla and Auca Mahuida basalts and finally, a melt component with similarities to peridotite melts contributing to many low Nb/U lavas. The high Nb/U type basalts are interpreted to have been formed from mantle with higher temperature than ambient mantle while the low Nb/U basalts may have been formed from normal temperature mantle.",

        "abstract": "The Kola Peninsula is characterized by diverse alkaline magmatism, including alkaline ultramafic, carbonatite, \u201ckimberlite\u201d and agpaitic rocks, although many aspects of the ages of emplacement and petrogenesis remain unresolved. In this study, rocks from the Afrikanda complex (pyroxenite, ijolite, melteigite, carbonatite, and perovskite ore) were selected for U\u2013Pb age determination and Sr\u2013Nd isotopic analyses using in situ ion probe and laser ablation techniques. The perovskite U\u2013Pb ages are 377 \u00b1 6 (pyroxenite), 379 \u00b1 5 to 385 \u00b1 5 (calcite-bearing perovskite ore) and 376 \u00b1 5 (ijolite\u2013melteigite) Ma, indicating that the different phases of the complex were contemporaneously emplaced at ~ 380 Ma. These ages are comparable to those obtained previously for Afrikanda rocks, and other alkaline ultramafic, carbonatitic, \u201ckimberlitic\u201d and agpaitic complexes in the area; suggesting that the majority of alkaline magmatism in the Kola Peninsula occurred at ~ 375\u2013380 Ma. Sr\u2013Nd isotopic analyses of perovskite, titanite, apatite, and calcite indicate that the Afrikanda complex was derived from a depleted mantle. However, these data suggest that silicate and carbonatitic magmas are not related by simple crystal fractionation within a closed magmatic system. The silicate magma has an initial Sr/Sr isotopic ratio of ~ 0.7034 to 0.7038 and \u03b5(t) value of ~+2.0 to + 4.9, whereas the carbonatitic magma was more primitive with the above values of ~ 0.7033 to 0.7035 and \u03b5(t) ~ + 5.1 to + 5.8, suggesting that either both magmas were derived from two distinct mantle sources or by contamination of a melts derived from a single source. In combination with other geochronological and geochemical data for other complexes in the area, it is proposed that the Kola alkaline magmatism was controlled by mantle plume activity at ~ 380 Ma.\u25ba Perovskite U\u2013Pb ages are determined for the alkaline Afrikanda complex in Russia. \u25ba The various phases were synchronously emplaced at ~ 380 Ma. \u25ba Sr\u2013Nd isotopic data suggest that the magma was derived from depleted mantle. \u25ba The Kola Paleozoic magmatism was triggered by mantle plume activity.",

        "abstract": "Results of a wide-ranging isotopic investigation of the unique Antarctican angrite LEW-86010 (LEW) are presented, together with a reassessment of the type angrite Angra dos Reis (ADOR). The principal objectives of this study are to obtain precise radiometric ages, initial Sr isotopic compositions, and to search for the erstwhile presence of the short-lived nuclei Sm and Al via their daughter products. The isotopic compositions of Sm, U, Ca, and Ti were also measured. This allows a detailed appraisal to be made of the relations between, and the geneology of, these two angrites.LEW proves to be severely contaminated with modern terrestrial Pb, which is shown to result from terrestrial weathering. Nevertheless, concordant Pb-Pb model ages of pyroxene separates were obtained (2\u03c3): 4.55784 \u00b1 52 Ga for LEW and 4.55780 \u00b1 42 Ga for ADOR. Uranium isotopic compositions are normal within error. The inferred initial Pb isotopic composition is within error of primordial Pb, as defined by Ca\u00f1on Diablo troilite. Because of the extreme ratios of both angrites, this places an upper limit of ~2 Ma on the time between volatile element-loss of the angrite parent body or its precursor planetesimals and the final crystallization of the angrites as differentiates. Initial ratios were found to be indistinguishable in LEW, ADOR, and the cumulate eucrite Moore County. The derived initial for all three meteorites is 0.698970 \u00b1 15 (2\u03c3). A Sm-Nd isochron for LEW was obtained, yielding an age of 4.553 \u00b1 34 Ga with an initial of 0.506682 \u00b1 49 (2\u03c3). SmNd isotope systematics were also measured. Anomalies on Nd arising from extinct Sm were clearly resolved, resulting in an initial of 0.0071 \u00b1 17 with = \u22122.57 \u00b1 0.62 at the time of isotopic closure. Both of these Sm-Nd methods imply derivation of LEW from a reservoir with chondritic ratio; they are also quite consistent with the previously reported systematics for ADOR. Overall, the age and isotopic similarities between LEW and ADOR are striking; it suggests almost simultaneous production on the same asteroid, even though recent experimental studies imply that the two are not comagmatic.Calcium and titanium do not exhibit enrichments in the -rich isotopes, in contrast to CAIs, making it unlikely that the angrite parent body is inherently rich in early condensates from the solar nebula. No evidence was found for live Al in LEW. When combined with the Pb-Pb age and initial data, this firmly excludes Al being an important heat source in the early solar system; heat supplied for, for example, (1) the differentiation of the angrite and eucrite parent bodies, and (2) metamorphism of the chondrite parent bodies must come from some other source. The debate over live vs. extinct Al in the earliest solar system remains unresolved by this new data from LEW, however.Both the angrite and eucrite parent bodies have extremely low and high ratios compared to the solar nebula. Therefore, the common initial of 0.698970 can be firmly associated with the U-Pb angrite age above, and the formation of both bodies. This enables an absolute chronology of the early solar system to be established. Based upon differences, the oldest CAIs are a minimum of 11 \u00b1 4 Ma older than the angrites, i.e., 4.569 \u00b1 5 Ga. The age and isotopic constraints are discussed with respect to current collapse, condensation, and accretion timescales calculated for the solar nebula.",

        "abstract": "The Dadian alkaline intrusive complex is located within the Sulu orogenic belt, and includes hornblende syenite, syenite, quartz syenite and syenite porphyry. All the rocks from the complex show high SiO, KO + NaO and LREE and low CaO, FeO, MgO and HFSE (Nb, Ta, P, Ti) concentrations. The Sr, Nd, and Hf isotopic compositions ((Sr/Sr) = 0.708505\u20130.70876, \u03b5() = \u2212 16.5 to \u2212 17.9, \u03b5() = \u2212 21.5 to \u2212 16.4) of the rocks fall within the compositional field of mafic dykes occurring nearby, suggesting that the Dadian alkaline complex was mainly derived from an enriched lithospheric mantle. The initial Pb compositions ((Pb/Pb) = 16.706\u201316.779, (Pb/Pb) = 15.427\u201315.450, (Pb/Pb) = 37.266\u201337.352) of the Dadian rocks are lower than those of the Yangtze lithospheric mantle, albeit similar to that reported from beneath the North China Craton, implying that the mantle source of the Dadian alkaline complex most likely belong to the North China Craton. The relatively high SiO and HREE contents and low Nb/Ta ratios as well as strongly negative Eu and Sr anomalies of some of the rocks from the Dadian complex suggest that crustal material was also involved in the formation of this complex and that the crustal component was probably derived through partial melting at low pressure. The high crystallization temperatures revealed by zircon saturation thermometry and low pressures suggested by Al-in-hornblende barometry indicate that the Dadian alkaline complex crystallized at high temperature and intruded into shallow crustal level. This intrusive complex does not show any relationship with post-orogenic process in the region, and its petrogenesis is inferred to be associated with the Paleo-Pacific subduction tectonics.\u25ba We report the Dadian alkaline complex was mainly derived from an enriched lithospheric mantle and contaminated by crustal material during magma ascend. \u25ba Our study has important implications on the crust\u2013mantle interaction in the Sulu orogenic belt and concluded that this intrusive complex does not show any relationship with post-orogenic process in the region, and its petrogenesis is inferred to be associated with the Paleo-Pacific subduction tectonics.",

        "abstract": "The evolution of the mantle source beneath the Tepl\u00e1-Barrandian (TBB) and the adjacent southern part of the Saxo-Thuringian (S-STB) and northern part of the Moldanubian (N-MB) blocks of the Bohemian Massif (Czech Republic) is tracked from the Late Neoproterozoic to the Cenozoic in order to examine the coupling between the crust and underlying continental lithospheric mantle (CLM) during the Late Paleozoic Variscan orogeny. In the TBB, Late Neoproterozoic mafic rocks have highly radiogenic Nd but moderately radiogenic Sr isotopes and were derived from a spinel peridotite mantle. These within-plate rocks were emplaced in an intra-oceanic back-arc basin. Early Paleozoic (Ordovician to Early Devonian) mafic rocks are rift/extension-related, enriched in LREE and Nb relative to HREE and were probably derived from a garnet peridotite mantle source. Compared to Neoproterozoic basalts, their \u0190() values are slightly lower but T model ages are indistinguishable suggesting derivation from a deeper portion of the same mantle source. Thus, the weak deformation and low-grade metamorphism associated with the Cadomian orogeny did not significantly decouple the crust from the underlying mantle source beneath the TBB. Early Paleozoic rift-related mafic rocks of the S-STB and N-MB have comparable isotopic signatures indicating a similar mantle source. Late Paleozoic mafic magmatism occurred during the extensional collapse phase of the Variscan orogen, in the aftermath of the collision between Gondwana and Laurussia. The TBB and S-STB basaltic rocks are within-plate, and transitional between alkaline and tholeiitic compositions but show a relative depletion of Nb. Their isotopic characteristics contrast with older basalts in that they have negative \u0190() values, high initial Sr/Sr ratios and older T model ages (1050 to 1300\u202fMa). Late Paleozoic mantle-derived potassic-ultrapotassic magmas occurring as lamprophyre dikes and small volume high MgK intrusions in N-MB, S-STB and TBB have similar isotopic characteristics suggesting that all these Late Paleozoic rocks were derived from an old CLM contaminated by fluids or silicic melts derived from subducted Precambrian crustal material or alternatively, the region was underthrust by Gondwanan mantle during the Variscan collision. Cenozoic volcanic rocks in the Bohemian Massif are local representatives of the regionally extensive Cenozoic European volcanic province. The rocks are within-plate, alkaline basalts enriched in LREE and Nb and were derived from garnet peridotite mantle. They are significantly more juvenile than Carboniferous-Early Permian mafic rocks, with higher \u0190() values (typically +3 to +5), lower initial Sr/Sr ratios and significantly younger T age. These data suggest significant input from upwelling asthenospheric mantle, implying that at least a part of the Permian CLM mantle was re-fertilized.",

        "abstract": "We present combined U\u2013Pb, Sr, and Nd isotope data for small perovskite crystal fractions from kimberlites in West Greenland. Based on this high-precision TIMS data set, we revise the age range for kimberlite magma emplacement in the Sarfartoq and Tikiusaaq fields to 550\u2013590 Ma and 158\u2013166 Ma, respectively. These improved U\u2013Pb perovskite age constraints reinforce the close temporal association of kimberlite and carbonatite magmatism across the North Atlantic craton.The new combined U\u2013Pb, Sr, and Nd isotope data for perovskites provide evidence for kimberlite magma derivation from a moderately depleted mantle source region during both the Neoproterozoic and Mesozoic. Moreover, we demonstrate that the difference in initial Sr\u2013Nd isotope compositions between the Neoproterozoic Sarfartoq (Sr/Sr = 0.70278\u20130.70293; \u03b5 = + 1.6 to + 3.6; n = 13) and Mesozoic Tikiusaaq (Sr/Sr = 0.70319\u20130.70346; \u03b5 = + 4.8 to + 5.1; n = 3) kimberlite fields can be readily explained by isotopic evolution of a common mantle reservoir. This mantle reservoir appears to have continuously participated in global crust\u2013mantle differentiation and recycling, which points to the well-stirred convective upper mantle as the ultimate kimberlite magma source region beneath West Greenland. The apparent geographic shift of kimberlite and associated carbonatite magmatic activity from the craton margin during the Neoproterozoic toward the craton center during the Mesozoic is explained by changes in localized, small-scale mantle flow along the underside of progressively thinning cratonic lithosphere.\u25ba Coeval Greenland kimberlites and carbonatites are related to a common carbonate-rich precursor magma. \u25ba Perovskite Sr\u2013Nd isotope systematics suggest a convective mantle origin for Greenland kimberlites. \u25ba Distinct Sr\u2013Nd isotope compositions of 550\u2013590 and 158\u2013166 Ma Greenland kimberlites are due to convecting mantle evolution. \u25ba First Sr\u2013Nd isotope data for Mesozoic Greenland kimberlites",

        "abstract": "The Eastern Pontides in NE Turkey is one of the major orogenic belts in Anatolia. In this paper, we report our new Ar/Ar dating, mineral chemistry, major and trace elements and Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Pb isotopic analyses of the lamprophyre intrusions in this region. The lamprophyres are widely scattered and intrude Late Carboniferous granitoid rocks. The lamprophyres exhibit fine-grained textures and are mineralogically uniform. Hornblende Ar/Ar dating yielded a plateau age of 216.01 \u00b1 10.64 Ma. Based on their geochemistry, mineral compositions and paragenesis, the lamprophyres are classified as calc-alkaline lamprophyres in general and spessartites in particular, which are rich in large ion lithophile elements (e.g., Rb, Ba, K) but depleted in Nb and Ti. Our samples exhibit moderate fractionation in LREE patterns approximately 100 times that of chondrite but HREE abundances less than 10 times that of chondrite. These calc-alkaline lamprophyres display a range of I (216 Ma) values from 0.70619 to 0.71291 and \u03b5 (216 Ma) values from \u2212 1.4 to 4.1, with = 1.11 to 2.20 Ga. Their Pb isotopic ratios indicate an enriched mantle source. The enrichment process is related to metasomatism of a subcontinental lithospheric mantle source, which is caused by a large quantity of HO-rich fluids, rather than sediments released from oceanic crust at depth during the closure of the Paleotethys Ocean in Triassic times. All of the geochemical data and the trace element modeling suggest that the primary magma of the calc-alkaline to high-K calc-alkaline spessartites was generated at depth by a low degree of partial melting (~ 1\u201310%) of a previously enriched lithospheric mantle wedge consisting of phlogopite-bearing spinel peridotite. The ascendance of a hot asthenosphere triggered by extensional events caused partial melting of mantle material. The rising melts were accompanied by fractional crystallization and crustal contamination en route to the surface. All of the geochemical features combined with regional data suggest that the Eastern Pontides calc-alkaline lamprophyres originated in an extensional environment along an active continental margin throughout the Late Triassic. Such an extensional event, causing upwelling of hot asthenosphere, led to the opening of the northern branch of the Neotethys as a back-arc basin farther south of the Eastern Pontides.",

        "abstract": "The Sakhalin-Hokkaido orogenic belt along the western margin of the Okhotsk Sea is an important early Cenozoic accretionary orogen related to subduction of the Paleo-Pacific oceanic plate. In order to study the Eocene evolution of this accretionary orogen and related magmatism, we carried out zircon UPb dating, whole-rock elemental and SrNd isotopic analyses on the Langeri and Val'za granitic plutons that intruded the East Sakhalin accretionary complex in the central Sakhalin Island. Zircon UPb dating results revealed that the Langeri and Val'za plutons were emplaced in the late Eocene at 38\u201336\u202fMa. Whole-rock elemental data indicate that granitoids are mainly peraluminous S-type with subordinate I-type granites, and all granitic samples show arc-like geochemical affinity. Whole-rock SrNd isotopic results show consistent low initial Sr/Sr ratios (0.7042 to 0.7049), positive \u03b5(t) values (+1.7 to +3.1) and young Nd two-stage model ages (611 to 717\u202fMa). Elemental and isotopic data reveal that granitic rocks of the Langeri and Val'za plutons were generated from remelting of metasediments and amphibolites in the accretionary complex. From comprehensive analyses of regional tectonics, we concluded that the late Eocene granitic rocks were generated in a -collisional tectonic setting, marking the timing for formation of the Sakhalin-Hokkaido orogenic belt. The middle-late Eocene welding of the Okhotsk Sea Plate and the Eurasia Plate is the most plausible mechanism that caused crustal thickening beneath the Sakhalin Island, and anatexis of metasediments and oceanic crustal materials in the lower crust might be responsible for the formation of late Eocene granitic rocks. Considering the Eocene tectonic events in NE Asia, late Paleocene to early Eocene subduction of the Kula-Pacific ridge beneath the Hokkaido Island and Eocene initial rift of pull-apart basins along strike-slip fault system in the Hokkaido and Sakhalin Islands may also contribute to the emplacement of Eocene magmatism in the Sakhalin-Hokkaido orogenic belt.",

        "abstract": "The major and trace elements and Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Pb isotopes of the host rocks and the mafic microgranular enclaves (MME) gathered from the D\u00f6lek and Sari\u00e7i\u00e7ek plutons, Eastern Turkey, were studied to understand the underlying petrogenesis and geodynamic setting. The plutons were emplaced at \u223c 43 Ma at shallow depths (\u223c 5 to 9 km) as estimated from Al-in hornblende geobarometry. The host rocks consist of a variety of rock types ranging from diorite to granite (SiO = 56.98\u201372.67 wt.%; Mg# = 36.8\u201350.0) populated by MMEs of gabbroic diorite to monzodiorite in composition (SiO = 53.21\u201360.94 wt.%; Mg# = 44.4\u201353.5). All the rocks show a high-K calc-alkaline differentiation trend. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns are moderately fractionated and relatively flat [(La/Yb) = 5.11 to 8.51]. They display small negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu = 0.62 to 0.88), with enrichment of LILE and depletion of HFSE. Initial Nd\u2013Sr isotopic compositions for the host rocks are (43 Ma) = \u2212 0.6 to 0.8 and mostly = 0.70482\u20130.70548. The Nd model ages () vary from 0.84 to 0.99 Ga. The Pb isotopic ratios are (Pb/Pb) = 18.60\u201318.65, (Pb/Pb) = 15.61\u201315.66 and (Pb/Pb) = 38.69\u201338.85. Compared with the host rocks, the MMEs are relatively homogeneous in isotopic composition, with ranging from 0.70485 to 0.70517, (43 Ma) \u2212 0.1 to 0.8 and with Pb isotopic ratios of (Pb/Pb) = 18.58\u201318.64, (Pb/Pb) = 15.60\u201315.66 and (Pb/Pb) = 38.64\u201338.77. The MMEs have ranging from 0.86 to 1.36 Ga. The geochemical and isotopic similarities between the MMEs and their host rocks indicate that the enclaves are of mixed origin and are most probably formed by the interaction between the lower crust- and mantle-derived magmas. All the geochemical data, in conjunction with the geodynamic evidence, suggest that a basic magma derived from an enriched subcontinental lithospheric mantle, probably triggered by the upwelling of the asthenophere, and interacted with a crustal melt that originated from the dehydration melting of the mafic lower crust at deep crustal levels. Modeling based on the Sr\u2013Nd isotope data indicates that \u223c 77\u201383% of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle involved in the genesis. Consequently, the interaction process played an important role in the genesis of the hybrid granitoid bodies, which subsequently underwent a fractional crystallization process along with minor amounts of crustal assimilation, en route to the upper crustal levels generating a wide variety of rock types ranging from diorite to granite in an extensional regime.",

        "abstract": "Geological observation in the eastern end of the Himalayas shows that the Asia/India suture is folded and continues southward into India and Burma where the continuation of the Transhimalayan plutonic complex can be identified. Metamorphic rocks derived from India occur structurally below the suture, in the core of a regional antiform. Isotopic and fission track dating are consistent with the geological interpretation. In addition, they establish cooling exhumation of rocks from . 30 km depth within the last 4 Ma. Rapid exhumation of deep crustal levels in mountain systems is generally related to extension subsequent to thermal softening of a thickened continental lithosphere. However, in the Eastern Himalayas, we argue that exhumation is caused by . 10 mm yr erosion coeval with crustal scale folding. The general history of this syntaxis resembles the evolution of the western Himalayas syntaxis in Pakistan.",

        "abstract": "Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr isotopic analyses are reported for granulite facies orthogneisses from Fiordland southwest New Zealand. Whole-rock samples define a Rb-Sr isochron age of 120\u00b115 Ma and an initial 87Sr/86Sr ratio of 0.70391\u00b14. \u025bNd values (at 120 Ma) show a relatively wide range of from \u22120.4 to 2.7 indicating decoupling of Sr-Nd isotope systems. Associated ultramafic rocks have initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios of from 0.70380 to 0.70430 and \u025bNd values of from 0.1 to 3.0. The different initial ratios suggest that the various intrusions, although contemporaneous, were not derived through fractionation of a single parent magma. A metasedimentary enclave incorporated during emplacement of the granulitic rocks preserves a Proterozoic isotopic signature with a measured \u025bNd(0) value of \u221210.2, 87Sr/86Sr ratio of 0.73679 and a TNd provenance age of 1490 Ma. The Rb-Sr whole rock age of the granulites is the same as obtained from recent U-Pb zircon dating (Mattinson et al. 1986) and is interpreted as the time of magmatic emplacement and essentially contemporaneous granulite facies metamorphism. Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd analyses of mineral systems indicate that the terrain had cooled below \u223c300\u00b0 C by \u223c100 Ma providing further evidence that high grade metamorphism was of exceptionally short duration.Unmetamorphosed leucogabbros from the Early Cretaceous Darran Complex of eastern Fiordland have significantly higher \u025bNd values (3.9 to 4.6) and slightly lower 87Sr/ 86Sr (0.70373 to 0.70386) than the western Fiordland granulites. This indicates that the western and eastern Fiordland complexes are not correlative although both have geochemical similarities to Phanerozoic calc-alkaline island-arc suites. The Fiordland granulites are LREE enriched (LaN/ YbN=12 to 40) and have trace element characteristics (e.g. high K/Rb and low Rb/Sr ratios) typical of many Rb-depleted Precambrian granulite terrains. The Fiordland trace element trends, however are attributed to magmatic, not metamorphic processes, reflecting the character of the Early Cretaceous magma sources. The range of \u025bNd values, but uniform initial 87Sr/86Sr of the western Fiordland granulites is consistent with derivation of the parent Early Cretaceous magmas at least in part from a LREE enriched, low Rb/Sr protoliths of mid-to late-Paleozoic age. Partial melting of this protolith occurred during or immediately preceding a period of great crustal thickening culminating in rapid thickening of existing crust by \u223c20 km following emplacement of the granulitic rocks. The rapid crustal thickening was probably a consequence of a collisional event in which an Early Cretaceous magmatic arc was over-ridden by one or more thrust sheets.",

        "abstract": "We present field, petrographic, Sm\u2013Nd whole-rock isochron and whole-rock geochemical data for komatiites from Sargur Group greenstone belts of the western Dharwar craton. Field evidence such as pillow structure indicates their eruption in a marine environment. Petrographic data reveal that the igneous mineralogy has been altered during post-magmatic hydrothermal alteration processes corresponding to greenschist- to lower amphibolite facies conditions with rarely preserved primary olivine and orthopyroxene. A 16-point Sm\u2013Nd whole-rock isochron gives an age of 3352 \u00b1 110 Ma for the timing of eruption of komatiite lavas. About 60% of the studied komatiite samples show Al-depletion whilst the remaining are Al-undepleted. The Al-depleted komatiites are characterised by high CaO/AlO ratios (1.01\u20131.34) and low AlO/TiO (5\u201316) whereas Al-undepleted komatiites show lower CaO/AlO ratios (0.59\u20130.99) and higher AlO/TiO (17\u201326). Trace element distribution patterns of komatiites suggest that most of the primary geochemical and Nd isotopic compositions are preserved with only minor influence of post-magmatic alteration processes and negligible crustal contamination. The chemical characteristics of Al-depleted komatiites, such as high (Gd/Yb) together with lower HREE, Y, Zr and Hf, imply their derivation from deeper upper mantle with garnet (majorite?) involvement, whereas lower (Gd/Yb) slightly higher HREE, Y, Zr and Hf suggest derivation from shallower upper mantle without garnet involvement. The observed chemical characteristics (CaO/AlO, AlO/TiO, MgO, Ni, Cr, Nb, Zr, Y, Hf, REE) indicate derivation of the komatiite magmas from different depths in a plume setting, whereas sub-contemporaneous felsic volcanism and TTG accretion can be attributed to an arc setting. In order to explain the spatial association of komatiite volcanism with contemporaneous mafic-felsic volcanism and TTG accretion we propose a combined plume-arc setting. Nd isotope data of the studied komatiites indicate depleted mantle reservoirs which may have evolved by early (>4.53 Ga) global differentiation of the silicate Earth as suggested by Boyet and Carlson [Boyet, M., Carlson, R.W., 2005. Nd evidence for early (>4.53 Ga) global differentiation of silicate Earth. Science 309, 577\u2013581] or extraction of continental crust during the early Archaean.",

        "abstract": "Whole-rock isotope ratio (Hf, Nd, Pb, Sr) and trace element data for basement rocks at ocean drilling Sites U1438, 1201 and 447 immediately west of the KPR (Kyushu-Palau Ridge) are compared to those of FAB (forearc basalts) previously interpreted to be the initial products of IBM subduction volcanism. West-of-KPR basement basalts (drill sites U1438, 1201, 447) and FAB occupy the same Hf-Nd and Pb-Pb isotopic space and share distinctive source characteristics with \u03b5 mostly\u202f>\u202f16.5 and up to \u03b5\u202f=\u202f19.8, which is more radiogenic than most Indian mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB). Lead isotopic ratios are depleted, with Pb/Pb\u202f=\u202f17.8\u201318.8 accompanying relatively high Pb/Pb, indicating an Indian-MORB source unlike that of West Philippine Basin plume basalts. Some Sr isotopes show affects of seawater alteration, but samples with Sr/Sr\u202f<\u202f0.7034 and \u03b5\u202f>\u202f8.0 appear to preserve magmatic compositions and also indicate a common source for west-of-KPR basement and FAB. Trace element ratios resistant to seawater alteration (La/Yb, Lu/Hf, Zr/Nb, Sm/Nd) in west-of-KPR basement are generally more depleted than normal MORB and so also appear similar to FAB. At Site U1438, only andesite sills intruding sedimentary rocks overlying the basement have subduction-influenced geochemical characteristics (\u03b5\u202f\u223c\u202f6.6, \u03b5\u202f\u223c\u202f13.8, La/Yb\u202f>\u202f2.5, Nd/Hf\u202f\u223c\u202f9). The key characteristic that unites drill site basement rocks west of KPR and FAB is the nature of their source, which is more depleted in lithophile trace elements than average MORB but with Hf, Nd, and Pb isotope ratios that are common in MORB. The lithophile element-depleted nature of FAB has been linked to initiation of IBM subduction in the Eocene, but Sm-Nd model ages and errorchron relationships in Site U1438 basement indicate that the depleted character of the rocks is a regional characteristic that was produced well prior to the time of subduction initiation and persists today in the source of modern IBM arc volcanic rocks with Sm/Nd\u202f>\u202f0.34 and \u03b5\u202f\u223c\u202f9.0.",

        "abstract": "The Alborz Magmatic Assemblage (AMA) is an Eocene volcanic complex in northern Iran, and is situated at the site of the closure of the Tethyan basin. The magmatic rocks of the Alborz assemblage exhibit a distinct progression in style, from shallow submarine explosive eruptions to more effusive sub-aerial eruptions. Their chemical compositions indicate that they belong to the high-K calc\u2010alkaline (shoshonitic) suite, and are related to either a subduction regime or continental collision. This conclusion is verified by major and trace element abundances, such as enrichments in Light Rare Earth Elements (LREEs) and Large Ion Lithophile Elements (LILEs) (e.g., K, U, and Sr) and depletion in High Field Strength Elements (HFSEs) (e.g., Nb, Ta, Ti, and Zr). However, HFSE plots suggest that the source region of the AMA magmas was affected by multiple processes, including deeply subducted lithosphere and the partial melts of extensional lithosphere in a back-arc environment.The isotopic composition of this suite and their trace element ratios suggest that the primary magmas were derived from a depleted mantle source and were subsequently affected by both fractional crystallization (ol + cpx in basic magmas and plg + bio \u00b1 hbl in intermediate magmas) and assimilation during magmatic evolution. Assimilation and fractional crystallization modeling, based on isotopic and trace element ratios, indicates that the ascending magmas were contaminated by approximately 40% continental crust.The petrography and geochemical composition of the Eocene Alborz magmatic assemblage indicate that it developed in a back-arc basin, in which explosive eruptions produced various pyroclastic and epiclastic deposits. A subsequent stage of volcanism then produced more effusive sub\u2010aerial eruptions, as well as sporadic explosions that generated ignimbritic sheets.\u25ba Stratigraphy and facies analysis of Eocene volcanics in the Alborz zone, Iran. \u25ba Deciphering the geochemical and isotopic characteristics of Eocene magmatic rocks. \u25ba Modeling of magmatic differentiation and crystallization in magmatic chambers. \u25ba Modeling of tectono\u2010magmatic evolutions of two dominant volcanic belts in Iran.",

The granitoids have ages between Late Cretaceous and Miocene, but mainly belong to two groups: Eocene in the north and Miocene in the south. The Miocene granitoids have associated volcanic rocks; the Eocene granitoids do not display such associations. They are both granodioritic and granitic in composition, and are metaluminous, calc-alkaline, medium to high-K rocks. Their trace elements patterns are similar to both volcanic-arc and calc-alkaline post-collision intrusions, and the granitoids plot into the volcanic arc granite (VAG) and collision related granite areas (COLG) of discrimination diagrams.

U\u2013Pb SHRIMP zircon data suggest that the gneisses contain Famatinian igneous detritus, so that their sedimentary protoliths were probably deposited in a forearc basin and then rapidly underthrust and accreted to the lower crust of the arc, essentially coevally with arc magmatism at 468 \u00b1 4 Ma. Chemically and isotopically juvenile garnetiferous amphibolites within the gneisses are recognised as representing the most primitive magmas so far observed in this belt, which has often been considered to be a continental arc derived from isotopically mature sources.

        "abstract": "During an uplift phase, which lasted ca. 40 Ma, from the Late Jurassic (165 Ma) to the Early Cretaceous (125 Ma), transitional to moderately alkaline magmatic series were emplaced in the Central High Atlas. The corresponding magmatic products include basaltic lava flows erupted within wide synclines and intrusive complexes composed of layered mafic intrusions and monzonitic to syenitic dykes emplaced along narrow anticlinal ridges. The igneous rock sequence within the intrusive complexes is composed of troctolites, olivine-gabbros, oxide-gabbros, monzonites and syenites. The chemical compositions of the various intrusive rocks can be accounted for by crystal accumulation, fractional crystallization and post-magmatic remobilization. The evolution from the troctolites to the syenites was mainly controlled by a fractional crystallization process marked by early fractionation of olivine, plagioclase and clinopyroxene, followed by separation of biotite, amphibole, apatite, and Ti-magnetite. Hydrothermal activity associated with emplacement of the intrusions within the Jurassic limestones modified the elemental and the Sr isotopic composition of the hydrothermally altered rocks In particular the monzonitic to syenitic dykes underwent an alkali metasomatism marked by depletion in K and Rb and enrichment in Na and Sr. As a result, their Sr isotopic composition was shifted towards higher initial Sr isotopic ratios (0.7067\u20130.7075) with respect to the associated gabbros (0.7036\u20130.7046). On the contrary, the Nd isotopic compositions were preserved from isotope exchange with the limestones and vary in a similar range to those of the gabbros (+1.6 < \u03b5Ndi < +4.1). The isotopic and the trace element ratios of the uncontaminated samples were used to constrain the source characteristics of this magmatism. The Sr-Nd isotopic data and the incompatible element ratios (e.g. La/Nb, Zr/Nb, Th/U, Ce/Pb) are consistent with generation from an enriched upper mantle similar to an ocean island basalt source. Melting of the subcontinental metasomatized lithosphere is tentatively related to small-scale shallow mantle upwelling and asthenospheric uprise at the triple junction between the western High Atlas, the Middle Atlas and the eastern High Atlas domains during a period of relative tectonic quiescence.",

        "abstract": "The isotopic compositions of Sr, Nd and Pb together with the abundances of Rb, Sr, U and Pb have been determined for mafic and felsic potassic alkaline rocks from the young Virunga volcanic field in the western branch of the East African rift system.Sr/Sr varies from 0.7055 to 0.7082 in the mafic rocks and from 0.7073 to 0.7103 in the felsic rocks. The latter all come from one volcano, Sabinyo. Sabinyo rocks have negative \u03b5values of\u03b5 = \u221210. Nd and Sr isotopic variations in the basic potassic rocks are correlated and plot between Sabinyo and previously reported [1] compositions (\u03b5 = +2.5;Sr/Sr\u2248 0.7047) for Nyiragongo nephelinites. The Pb isotopic compositions for Sabinyo rocks are nearly uniform and averagePb/Pb\u2248 19.4,Pb/Pb= 15.79\u201315.84,Pb/Pb\u2248 41.2. The basic potassic rocks have similarPb/Pb values but range inPb/Pb andPb/Pb from the Sabinyo values to less radiogenic compositions.Excellent correlations ofSr/Sr with Rb/Sr, 1/Sr andPb/Pb for Sabinyo rocks suggest these to be members of a hybrid magma series. However, the nearly uniform Pb compositions for this series points to radiogenic growth ofSr in the magma source region following an event which homogenized the isotopic compositions but not Rb/Sr. The Rb-Sr age derived from the erupted Sabinyo isochron-mixing line is consistent with the \u223c500 Myr Pb-Pb age from Nyiragongo [1], which suggests that this event affected all Virunga magma sources. The event can again be traced in the Pb-Pb, Pb-Sr and Nd-Sr isotopic correlations for all Virunga rocks, including Nyiragongo, when allowances are made for radiogenic growth subsequent to this mixing or incomplete homogenization event. Inferred parent/daughter element fractionations point to a metasomatic event during which a mantle fluid invaded two lithospheric reservoirs: a +\u03b5 reservoir sampled by the Nyiragongo nephelinites and suggested to be the subcontinental mantle and a \u2212\u03b5 reservoir sampled by the mafic and felsic potasssic volcanism. Whether this \u2212\u03b5 reservoir is the crust, continental crustal material in the mantle or anomalous mantle cannot be decided from the data. The simplest answer, that this reservoir is the continental crust, seems to be at variance with experimental evidence suggesting a subcrustal origin for basic potassic magmas. Partial melting of the ancient metasomatised lithospheric domains and ensuing volcanism seems to be entirely a response to decompression and rising geotherms during rifting and thinning of the lithosphere.",

        "abstract": "Post-collisional (26\u201310 Ma) high Sr/Y and HREE-depleted intrusive rocks occur in an E\u2013W trending belt paralleling the Yarlung\u2013Zangbo suture in south Tibet. Their petrogenesis has been a subject of debate. Here, we present chronological, geochemical and Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Hf isotopic data for two newly discovered large-volume high Sr/Y granitoids (the Pagu granodiorite and the Nanmuqie granite) and three high Sr/Y porphyries intruding the granitoids in the Lhasa terrane. LA-ICP-MS zircon U\u2013Pb dating for the Pagu granodiorite and Nanmuqie granite yielded identical magma crystallization ages of 14.0\u201314.4 Ma, which is indistinguishable from their associated high Sr/Y porphyries (14.2\u201314.6 Ma). The granitoid was intruded at middle-crust depth, whereas the porphyry was intruded at upper-crust depth, indicating that the Lhasa terrane has experienced a rapid crustal uplift during the high Sr/Y magma emplacement. Zircon Hf isotopic and whole-rock Sr\u2013Nd isotopic compositions for these granitoids and porphyries suggest that their magmas were dominantly derived from partial melting of crustal materials. The granitoids and porphyries have () values overlapping with the mafic granulites in the Himalayan terrane (Indian plate). Their Sr\u2013Nd isotopic compositions show two-endmember mixing between the Himalayan mafic lower crust and the ultrapotassic lavas/the Lhasa lower crust. We suggest that the high Sr/Y magmas in the Lhasa terrane could be derived from partial melting of subducted Indian mafic lower crust with incorporation of the ultrapotassic lava and/or the Lhasa lower crust components. Our study suggests a new model for the high Sr/Y magma generation in the Lhasa terrane and provides a line of geochemical evidence that the Indian continental crust was subducted beneath the southern Lhasa terrane in the early\u2013middle Miocene.",

        "abstract": "The composite Oberkirch pluton consists of three compositionally different units of peraluminous biotite granite. The northern unit is relatively mafic (SiO2\u223c64%) and lacks cordierite. The more felsic central and southern units (SiO2=67.8 to 70.4%) can only be distinguished from each other by the occurrence of cordierite in the former. Mafic microgranular enclaves of variable composition, texture and size occur in each of these units and are concentrated in their central domains. Most abundant are large (dm to m) hornblende-bearing enclaves with dioritic to tonalitic compositions (SiO2=50.8 to 56.3\u2009wt%; Mg#=63 to 41) and fine grained doleritic textures that suggest chilling against the host granite magma. Some of these enclaves are mantled by hybrid zones. Less common are microtonalitic enclaves containing biotite as the only primary mafic phase (SiO2=53.7 to 64.4%) and small hybrid tonalitic to granodioritic enclaves and schlieren. Synplutonic dioritic dikes (up to 6\u2009m thick) with hybrid transition zones to the host granite occur in the southern unit of the pluton. In chemical variation diagrams, samples from unmodified hornblende-bearing mafic enclaves and dikes form continuous trends that are compatible with an origin by fractionation of olivine, clinopyroxene, hornblende and plagioclase. Chemical and initial isotopic signatures (e.g. high Mg#, low Na2O, \u025bNd=\u22121.2 to \u22125.1, 87Sr/86Sr=0.7055 to 0.7080, \u03b418O=8.0 to 8.8\u2030) exclude an origin by partial melting from a mafic meta-igneous source but favour derivation from a heterogeneous enriched lithospheric mantle. Samples from the granitic host rocks do not follow the chemical variation trends defined by the diorites but display large scatter. In addition, their initial isotopic characteristics (\u025bNd=\u22124.5 to \u22126.8, 87Sr/86Sr=0.7071 to 0.7115, \u03b418O=9.9 to 11.9\u2030) show little overlap with those of the diorites. Most probably, the granitic magmas were derived from metapelitic sources characterized by variable amounts of garnet and plagioclase. This is suggested by relatively high molar ratios of Al2O3/(MgO+FeOtot) and K2O/Na2O, in combination with low ratios of CaO/(MgO+FeOtot), variable values of Sr/Nd, Eu/Eu*[=Eucn/(Smcn\u2009\u00d7\u2009Gdcn)0.5] and (Tb/Yb)cn (cn=chondrite-normalized) as well as variable abundances of Sc and Y. Whole-rock initial isotopic signatures of mafic microtonalitic enclaves (\u025bNd=\u22124.6 to \u22125.2; 87Sr/86Sr=0.7060 to 0.7073; \u03b418O \u223c8.1\u2030) are similar to those of the low \u025bNd diorites. Plagioclase concentrates from a granite sample and a mafic microtonalitic enclave are characterized by initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios that are significantly higher than those of their bulk rock systems suggesting incorporation of high 87Sr/86Sr crustal material into the magmas. Field relationships and petrographic evidence suggest that the Oberkirch pluton originated by at least three pulses of granitic magma containing mafic magma globules. In-situ hybridization between the different magmas was limited. Late injection of dioritic magma into the almost solidified granitic southern unit resulted in the formation of more or less continuous synplutonic dikes surrounded by relatively thin hybrid zones.",

        "abstract": "The Middle Urals are characterized by a major virgation in the linear trend of the Urals orogen, and represent the most highly contracted part of the late Palaeozoic collisional belt. This part of the orogen is dominated by metamorphic complexes and major fault and shear zones. The Main Uralian Fault zone (MUF), the east-dipping suture of the orogen containing low-grade metamorphic rocks, separates the Sysert Complex in the east from the Ufaley Complex in the west. The Sysert Complex in the hanging wall of the MUF consists of intensely deformed gneisses, granitic intrusions and a metamorphosed m\u00e9lange zone. Tectonic and isotopic investigations suggest the following stages for the evolution of the Sysert Complex: (a) pre-orogenic rifting and magmatism during Ordovician and Silurian times; (b) oceanic closure, island arc formation related to convergence and subduction during Devonian times; (c) major ductile deformation under amphibolite facies conditions related to NW-directed thrusting associated with crustal stacking during collision in Carboniferous times; (d) exhumation and contractional intracontinental tectonics during Permian times; and (e) closing of isotope systems related to cooling and the end of orogenic shortening through Triassic times. The Ufaley Complex, in the footwall of the MUF, is interpreted as an east-dipping crustal stack that records an amphibolite facies Uralian metamorphism. Lithologically the complex can be divided into pre-orogenic European basement (West Ufaley) and intensely deformed Palaeozoic metasediments and amphibolites (East Ufaley). High-pressure relics in the East Ufaley Complex are interpreted to be the result of subduction, whereas intense ductile deformation is related to overthrusting onto West Ufaley. The West Ufaley Complex is composed of gneisses, amphibolites, migmatites and granitic intrusions and has been thrust onto Devonian limestones along a major shear zone. In both Sysert and Ufaley Complexes, NW-trending stretching lineations and top-to-the-NW kinematic indicators suggest an oblique plate convergence with a significant sinistral component. The MUF is interpreted as a major normal fault that developed congruent with continental subduction and that compensated lithospheric thickening and the rapid exhumation of subducted crust in the footwall.",

        "abstract": "The Upper Jurassic volcanic rocks of the Pre-Cordillera and High Andes of northern Chile (26\u201331\u00b0S) represent a back-arc magmatic chain formed during an earlier stage of Andean subduction. After the Callovian, the back-arc basin gradually changed from marine to continental conditions and was characterized by basaltic to rhyolitic rocks erupted along two belts, parallel to the coeval arc. The western belt comprises the Picudo and Algarrobal formations, whereas the eastern belt comprises the Lagunillas Formation and the Quebrada Vicu\u00f1ita Beds. New major and trace element data, along with whole rock Sr, Nd and Pb isotopes are presented for these volcanic belts and compared to the geochemical features of the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous arc magmatism. Ar\u2013Ar and U\u2013Pb ages constrain the back arc volcanism to have evolved between 163.9 \u00b1 1.4 and 148.9 \u00b1 1.2 Ma.Rocks belonging to the western belt have steep multi-element patterns and low concentrations of HREE, suggesting the presence of garnet in the source, and a more radiogenic isotopic composition than the arc magmatism. Parental magmas of these back-arc lavas would have been generated through melting of a depleted mantle, although less depleted than the sub-arc mantle, and interacted with minor amounts of Paleozoic crust. The geochemical composition of the rocks belonging to the eastern belt is more heterogeneous and suggests involvement of different magmatic sources, including depleted mantle as well as an OIB-type mantle within the wedge. In spite the fact that the Jurassic Andean arc was built over a continental plate, the architecture of the volcanic chains and geochemical variations observed among the arc and back-arc rocks in northern Chile resemble those in modern island arcs, and thus support the hypothesis that early Andean subduction developed under extensional tectonic conditions.",

        "abstract": "We present a geochemical and isotopic study that, consistent with observed field relations, suggest Sangmelima late Archaean high-K granite was derived by partial melting of older Archaean TTG. The TTG formations are sodic-trondhjemitic, showing calcic and calc-alkalic trends and are metaluminous to peraluminous. High-K granites in contrast show a potassic calc-alkaline affinity that spans the calcic, calc-alkalic, alkali-calcic and alkalic compositions. The two rock groups (TTG and high-K granites) on the other hand are both ferroan and magnesian. They have a similar degree of fractionation for LREE but a different one for HREE. Nd model ages and Sr/Y ratios define Mesoarchaean and slab-mantle derived magma compositions respectively, with Nb and Ti anomalies indicating a subduction setting for the TTG. Major and trace element in addition to Sr and Nd isotopic compositions support field observations that indicate the derivation of the high-K granitic group from the partial melting of the older TTG equivalent at depth. Geochemical characteristics of the high-K granitic group are therefore inherited features from the TTG protolith and cannot be used for determining their tectonic setting. The heat budget required for TTG partial melting is ascribed to the upwelling of the mantle marked by a doleritic event of identical age as the generated high-K granite melts. The cause of this upwelling is related to linear delamination along mega-shear zones in an intracontinental setting.",

        "abstract": "The Arabian Shield preserves a protracted magmatic record of repeated amalgamation of juvenile subduction terranes that host granite intrusions ranging in age from the early Neoproterozoic to the Cambrian, which were emplaced into convergent and within-plate settings. Geochronology and whole-rock geochemistry of sampled Saudi Arabian granitoids define and distinguish four discrete age groups: 1) ~ 845\u2013700 Ma island arc and synorogenic granitoids (IA + Syn), 2) ~ 640\u2013610 Ma granitoids from the Nabitah and Halaban Suture (NHSG), 3) ~ 610\u2013600 Ma post-orogenic perthitic (hypersolvus) granitoids (POPG), and 4) < 600 Ma anorogenic aegirine-bearing perthitic (hypersolvus) granitoids (AAPG). Groups 1, 2 and 3 include suites ranging from I\u2013S- to A-type granites that have REE signatures typical of volcanic arc settings and show intra-suite variation that could be controlled by a combination of crustal assimilation and fractional crystallisation. Their mafic parental magmas have N-MORB-, or arc-tholeiite-like geochemistry. By contrast, group 4 A-type granites are more enriched in HREE and in incompatible elements such as Nb, Rb, Ga, Nd, Zr and Y and have lower Ce/Yb and higher Y/Nb ratios. These granitoids are interpreted to have been emplaced into within-plate and back-arc settings. Granitoid data also provide evidence that there may be two distinct mantle sources to the mafic parents of the granite suites. These are distinguished as contaminated and enriched mantle using Nb and Y and Nd isotopes. All granitoid suites are isotopically juvenile (\u025bNd + 3 to + 6) and fall between the upper field crustal values of the Paleoproterozoic Khida terrane (\u025bNd + 1) and contemporary depleted mantle. However, Nd isotopes distinguish contamination in group 1\u20133 mafic end-members beneath sutures which are interpreted to be derived from the contemporary MORB-type mantle wedge with subsequent crustal assimilation and fractionation to I- and A-type granitoids. The youngest (after 600 Ma) A-types (group 4) emplaced into extensional within-plate and back-arc settings require a new enriched mantle source that this study interprets to be associated with delamination.",

        "abstract": "The 62\u201352 Ma Ladybird granite (LBG) suite is a peraluminous, leucocratic, S-type, quartz monzonitic to granitic suite which occurs as batholiths, stocks, dikes, sills, and pegmatite veins predominantly in the high-grade rocks of the Shuswap complex, in southeastern British Columbia. The emplacement of the LBG was synchronous with the production of abundant migmatites within Thor\u2013Odin dome of the Monashee complex, an exposure of North American basement, exhumed from depths of ca. 26\u201333 km by Eocene extensional faults. The LBG and the leucosome in migmatites from Thor\u2013Odin dome have similar major and trace element patterns, and are both characterized by zircons which have inherited Precambrian cores. Whole rock Nd isotope compositions show a range of values for the LBG with Nd values from \u2212 5.0 to \u2212 17.2. The Nd for the leucosome samples range from \u2212 9.5 to \u2212 23.6, overlapping with those of the granitic suite. These data support the interpretation of a genetic link between formation of the LBG suite and melting of North American basement rocks, such as those exposed in the core of Thor\u2013Odin dome. The leucosome samples have lower high field strength element (HFSE) concentrations and positive Eu anomalies, whereas the LBG samples have higher HFSE concentrations and negative Eu anomalies. The similar trace element characteristics suggest that the leucosome from the migmatites and the LBG are related, whereby most of the leucosome samples are cumulates and the LBG samples represent evolved or residual melts. The initial Sr/Sr isotope values for both the LBG and leucosome samples have a large range. However, the initial Sr isotopic ratios for the LBG suite are lower than those of the leucosome samples, with Sr/Sr ranging from 0.70603 to 0.73688 and 0.74256 to 0.76593, respectively. This isotopic discrepancy suggests either: a) isotopic disequilibrium during partial melting in the mid- to lower crust where the leucosome formed, b) the distribution of Sr during partial melting was controlled by different melt-producing reactions, and/or c) isotopic heterogeneity in the source rocks. At least part of the LBG suite likely formed via melting of North American basement rocks that were dominantly of sedimentary origin. Melting of the Proterozoic supracrustal metasedimentary rocks overlying North American basement may also have contributed to the formation of the different phases of the suite found at the regional scale. However, the abundant leucosomes in the basement rocks of Thor\u2013Odin dome may mark the paths along which anatectic melt migrated in the structurally overlying Ladybird granites of the South Fosthall pluton.",

        "abstract": "In the Samail ophiolite,Sm-Nd,Rb-Sr, andO/O isotopic systems have been used to distinguish between sea-floor hydrothermal alteration and primary magmatic isotopic variations. The Rb-Sr andO/O isotopic systems clearly exhibit sensitivity to hydrothermal interactions with seawater while the Sm-Nd system appears essentially undisturbed. Internal isochrons have been determined by theSm-Nd method using coexisting plagioclase and pyroxene and give crystallization ages of 130 \u00b1 12m.y. from Ibra and 100 \u00b1 20 m.y. from Wadi Fizh. These ages are interpreted as the time of formation of the Samail oceanic crust and are older than the inferred emplacement age of 65\u201385 m.y. The initialNd/Nd ratios for a tectonized harzburgite, cumulate gabbros, plagiogranite, sheeted dikes and a basalt have a limited range in \u03b5 of from 7.5 to 8.6 for all lithologies, demonstrating a clear oceanic affinity and supporting earlier interpretations based on geologic observations and geochemistry. TheSr/Sr initial ratios on the same rocks have an extremely large range of from 0.70296 to 0.70650 (\u03b5 = \u221219.7 to +30.5) and the \u03b4O values vary from 2.6 to 12.7. These large variations are clearly consistent with hydrothermal interaction of seawater with the oceanic crust. A model is presented for the closed system exchange of Sr and O, that in principle illustrates how the Sr isotopic data may be utilized to estimate the water/rock ratio and subsequently used to evaluate the temperature of equilibration between the water and silicates from theO/O water-rock fractionation.",

        "abstract": "Oki-D\u014dzen (Japan) is a Late Miocene (7\u20135 Ma) intraplate alkalic volcano composed of a central trachytic pyroclastic complex surrounded by a ring-shaped succession of basaltic to trachybasaltic lavas and pyroclastic rocks and dispersed trachytic bodies. The central trachytic complex is in contact with a syenite that was intruded into the basement early Miocene volcano-sedimentary succession. In the centre of the system there are no alkalic basaltic rocks that are correlative of the outer flank ring. We present whole-rock major and trace element chemistry, Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Pb isotopic compositions and petrological data from the central trachytic volcanic complex and the intrusive syenite body, as well as from the outer ring basaltic succession. We also present and discuss a new set of zircon U/Pb ages collected from the central trachyte and syenite bodies. All the eruptive products of Oki-D\u014dzen, as well as the syenite, plot on a single liquid line of descent initiated from a mantle-derived alkalic basaltic parent. A younger (2.8 Ma) basaltic eruption (Uzuka basalt) has isotopic compositions that distinguish it from the rest of the system. Geochemical modelling indicates that magmatic differentiation through crystal fractionation and minor crustal assimilation occurred in crustal and shallow sub-volcanic magma reservoirs. In the central part of the system, a number of vertically spaced reservoirs acted as a filter, capturing basaltic dykes and hindering their ascent. In the outer region, dykes either reached the surface unhindered and erupted to form the basaltic/trachybasaltic succession or stalled at crustal levels and differentiated to trachyte before forming dispersed domes/flows. The central plumbing system \u201cfilter\u201d resulted in a nest-shaped volcano, with a trachytic core surrounded by basaltic products, and stopped direct injection of basaltic magmas into the shallow syenitic magma reservoir, likely preventing its destabilization and explosive eruption.",

        "abstract": "Controlling the accuracy and precision of geochemical analyses requires the use of characterized reference materials with matrices similar to those of the unknown samples being analyzed. We report a comprehensive Pb\u2010Sr\u2010Nd\u2010Hf isotopic and trace element concentration data set, combined with quantitative phase analysis by XRD Rietveld refinement, for a wide range of mafic to ultramafic rock reference materials analyzed at the Pacific Centre for Isotopic and Geochemical Research, University of British Columbia. The samples include a pyroxenite (NIM\u2010P), five basalts (BHVO\u20102, BIR\u20101a, JB\u20103, BE\u2010N, GSR\u20103), a diabase (W\u20102), a dolerite (DNC\u20101), a norite (NIM\u2010N), and an anorthosite (AN\u2010G); results from a leucogabbro (Stillwater) are also reported. Individual isotopic ratios determined by MC\u2010ICP\u2010MS and TIMS, and multielement analyses by HR\u2010ICP\u2010MS are reported with 4\u201312 complete analytical duplicates for each sample. The basaltic reference materials have coherent Sr and Nd isotopic ratios with external precision below 50 ppm (2SD) and below 100 ppm for Hf isotopes (except BIR\u20101a). For Pb isotopic reproducibility, several of the basalts (JB\u20103, BHVO\u20102) require acid leaching prior to dissolution. The plutonic reference materials also have coherent Sr and Nd isotopic ratios (<50 ppm), however, obtaining good reproducibility for Pb and Hf isotopic ratios is more challenging for NIM\u2010P, NIM\u2010N, and AN\u2010G due to a variety of factors, including postcrystallization Pb mobility and the presence of accessory zircon. Collectively, these results form a comprehensive new database that can be used by the geochemical community for evaluating the radiogenic isotope and trace element compositions of volcanic and plutonic mafic\u2010ultramafic rocks.",

        "abstract": "Southwest (SW) China hosts more than 26 Mo (Mo-only, Mo-dominated and Mo-bearing) deposits with a total reserve of > 2.5 Mt Mo metal. The region has become one of the most important Mo mineral provinces in China. These Mo deposits are usually fault-controlled, and are located mainly in: (1) Lhasa Terrane, characterized by widely distributed Yanshanian\u2013Himalayan igneous rocks; (2) Qiangtang Terrane, composed by Proterozoic and Early-Paleozoic crystalline basement and Devonian to Jurassic cover rocks; (3) East Kunlun Terrane, comprising Precambrian metamorphic rocks intruded by Paleozoic and Mesozoic granitoid plutons; (4) West Kunlun Terrane, characterized by Precambrian metamorphic basement, Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks, and Early-Paleozoic and Carboniferous\u2013Triassic arc-type plutons; and (5) Yidun arc, composed by Middle and Upper Triassic volcanic\u2013sedimentary successions. The Mo mineralization styles are dominated by porphyry-type, but also contain porphyry-skarn, skarn and porphyry-quartz vein types. Orebodies are vein-type or lensoidal, and are hosted by a variety of metamorphic, volcanic, granitic and sedimentary rocks of different ages. Fluid-rock interactions are exemplified by alteration zonation, which usually grades from an innermost potassic alteration zone, via a silicic/sericite alteration zone, to an outermost propylitic alteration zone. The initial high-temperature ore-forming fluids are magmatic in origin, and contain CO-bearing fluid inclusions. The initial ore-forming fluids would have then evolved to low-temperature, low-pressure, low-salinity and CO-poor (with meteoric water input) at the late alteration/mineralization stage. Causative granitoids for these Mo deposits have relatively high SiO, KO and AlO, and low TiO and MgO, showing a metaluminous to peraluminous high-K calc-alkaline to shoshonitic affinity. These granitoids exhibit significant depletions in Ba, Nb, Ta, P and Ti, and enrichments in Rb, Th, U and K. It is suggested that they were originated from partial melting of a lower rejuvenated crust, as evidenced by their Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic signatures. The Mo deposits in East and West Kunlun were formed in the Triassic (ca. 258\u2013214 Ma), related to the Paleo-Tethys Ocean subduction and the subsequent continental collision. Major Mo mineralization in the Qiangtang and Lhasa terranes mainly occurred during the syn-collisional compression to post-collisional extension transition of the Qiangtang\u2013Lhasa (ca. 43\u201335 Ma) and India\u2013Asia (ca. 30\u201314 Ma) collisions, respectively. The Late-Cretaceous Mo mineralization (ca. 88\u201373 Ma) in the Yidun arc was formed during the late- or post- Lhasa\u2013Qiangtang collision setting, or the intraplate extension led by the post-Himalayan escape tectonics. The wide range of molybdenite Re contents in these major SW Chinese Mo deposits indicates remarkable differences in metal, fluid sources and ages.",

        "abstract": "An integrated study of the geochronology, mineralogy, geochemistry and Sr\u2013Nd isotope compositions of the upper Permian Yushu mafic rocks in the central Tibetan Plateau (CTP) was conducted to evaluate the interaction between the Emeishan mantle plume and the Paleo-Tethyan subduction system. These mafic rocks can be geochemically subdivided into three groups. Group 1 rocks yielded a weighted mean Pb/U age of 258 \u00b1 2 Ma. They have relatively high TiO, FeO, Nb/Y and high \u03b5(t) values and display oceanic island basalts (OIB)-like rare earth and trace element patterns, with obvious enrichment of Nb and Ta. Group 2 and 3 rocks yield weighted mean Pb/U ages of 258 \u00b1 1 Ma and 257 \u00b1 1 Ma, respectively. Both have relatively low TiO, FeO, Nb/Y and \u03b5(t) values and island arc tholeiites (IAT)-like rare earth and trace element patterns with obvious depletion of Nb and Ta. However, the Group 2 rocks have relatively low FeO/MgO ratios, but high MgO, Mg, Cr and Ni contents, resembling primitive magmas. They have lower light rare earth element (LREE), Nb, Ti and Zr contents and higher \u03b5(t) values than the Group 1 rocks. The geochemical and isotopic variations suggest that the Group 1 rocks might be derived from a plume-related mantle source, whereas Group 2 and Group 3 rocks originated from subduction-modified asthenospheric mantle and lithospheric mantle. Moderate degrees of olivine and clinopyroxene fractionation under low oxygen fugacities (O) appear to be responsible for the Fe-Ti enrichment in the Group 1 rocks. We propose a model involving plume-subduction interaction to explain the geodynamics and generation of the late Permian mafic magmatism in the CTP. The study region was rifted by the Emeishan mantle plume activity in association with rollback of Longmuco-Shuanghu oceanic lithosphere in late Permian times. Deep melting of the plume source led to the generation of the Group 1 plume-related magmas, whereas shallower melting of the subduction-metasomatized asthenospheric and lithospheric mantle resulted in the generation of the Group 2 and Group 3 subduction-related magmas.",

        "abstract": "In the northern extension of the Famatina and the southern Puna (NW Argentina) prominent rhyolitic volcanic rocks traditionally referred to as Ordovician are exposed, resting on metamorphic basement and covered by thick Late Paleozoic siliciclastic successions. We report new U\u2013Pb SHRIMP ages from these rhyolites that show them to be of Mississippian (348\u2013342 Ma) age, thus identifying a previously unknown volcanic event in this portion of western Gondwana. Whole-rock geochemistry and Sr\u2013Nd isotopic analyses suggest a crustal source for these rocks but with a juvenile input (\u03b5(t) between \u2212 2.91 and \u2212 0.3, and T values between 1.09 and 1.1 Ga). This is different from the Early Paleozoic magmatism of western Argentina where crustal recycling took place without any involvement of mantle material. The Carboniferous magmatism is compatible with an extensional environment developed along the Terra Australis accretionary orogen as a result of tectonic switching processes. These rhyolites may be related to the coeval Mississippian A-type granites exposed to the east, in the Sierras Pampeanas, confirming the regional character of this magmatism.\u25ba For the first time Mississippian rhyolites are recognized in the Andes of Argentina. \u25ba Isotopic and geochemical data suggest crustal/mantle mixing processes. \u25ba These data are more compatible with extensional environments. \u25ba This interpretation differs from previous ones suggested for western Gondwana.",

        "abstract": "We present here a combined study of Early Cretaceous granodiorites, granites and mafic rocks from the Bengbu area on south-eastern margin of the North China Craton (NCC), in order to provide insights into the thinning mechanism of lithosphere on the cratonic margins. Zircon U\u2013Pb and Ar\u2013Ar dating reveals an adakitic\u2013basaltic\u2013granitic magma sequence with the adakitic intrusions (granodiorites; 123\u2013115 Ma) formed prior to the granites and mafic dykes (both ca.112 Ma). The granodiorites are geochemically similar to low-Mg# adakitic rocks and isotopically have enriched Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Hf compositions, low radiogenic Pb (Pb/Pb = 16.524\u201317.017), and mantle-like \u03b4O (5.8 \u00b1 0.5\u2030). They were originated from the thickened lower continental crust (LCC) of the NCC. In contrast, the granites have low Sr/Y (< 20), La/Yb, Dy/Yb, and prominent negative Eu anomalies, indicating their origination at the shallow middle-lower crustal levels. The mafic dykes are enriched in LREE relative to HREE, and exhibit negative anomalies of Nb, Ta, Ti and positive anomalies of Pb. They have low Nb/U, Ce/Pb, high La/Nb, Ba/Nb, enriched Sr\u2013Nd isotopic compositions and low radiogenic Pb (Pb/Pb = 16.789 to 17.262), indicating LCC materials involved into the mantle sources. Modeling suggests derivation of the mafic dykes from the depleted upper mantle hybridized by 10\u201315% recycled LCC. The contrasting chemical characteristics of adakitic rocks and granites imply that recycling of the LCC was likely achieved through rapid foundering at 115\u2013112 Ma, which resulted in thinning of the overlying crust and hybridization of the underlying mantle with closely coeval generation of granitic and basaltic magmas. Anatexis of the pre-existing thickened LCC at 123\u2013115 Ma that attenuated the LCC itself and left the residues denser as a result of felsic (adakitic) melt extraction is proposed to have resulted in gravitational instability and foundering of the lithosphere. Such a temporal sequence of magma generation and processes of lithospheric thinning also occurred on north margin of the NCC and are quite similar to the mountain-root removal beneath the Dabie Orogen in central China. This manifests that previous melting of the LCC is perhaps an important trigger responsible for lithospheric foundering in orogenic belts and cartonic margins, where the lithosphere underwent pre-thickening by continental collisions and had stabilized over a long time.\u25ba Early Cretaceous magmatism in Bengbu area shows a formation sequence of adakitic\u2013basaltic\u2013granitic. \u25ba The adakitic rocks derived from melting of thickened lower crust and normal granites from the shallow crust. \u25ba The mafic dykes originated from the mantle sources hybridized by foundered lower crust. \u25ba Lithospheric thinning was accomplished via rapid foundering of lower crust subjected to previous melting. \u25ba Widespread extraction of felsic adakitic melts from the lower crust was the major trigger for lithospheric foundering.",

        "abstract": "The Transcaucasian Massif (TCM) in the Republic of Georgia includes Neoproterozoic\u2013Early Cambrian ophiolites and magmatic arc assemblages that are reminiscent of the coeval island arc terranes in the Arabian\u2013Nubian Shield (ANS) and provides essential evidence for Pan-African crustal evolution in Western Gondwana. The metabasite\u2013plagiogneiss\u2013migmatite association in the Oldest Basement Unit (OBU) of TCM represents a Neoproterozoic oceanic lithosphere intruded by gabbro\u2013diorite\u2013quartz diorite plutons of the Gray Granite Basement Complex (GGBC) that constitute the plutonic foundation of an island arc terrane. The Tectonic M\u00e9lange Zone (TMZ) within the Middle-Late Carboniferous Microcline Granite Basement Complex includes thrust sheets composed of various lithologies derived from this arc-ophiolite assemblage. The serpentinized peridotites in the OBU and the TMZ have geochemical features and primary spinel composition (0.35) typical of mid-ocean ridge (MOR)-type, cpx-bearing spinel harzburgites. The metabasic rocks from these two tectonic units are characterized by low-K, moderate-to high-Ti, olivine-hypersthene-normative, tholeiitic basalts representing N-MORB to transitional to E-MORB series. The analyzed peridotites and volcanic rocks display a typical melt-residua genetic relationship of MOR-type oceanic lithosphere. The whole-rock Sm\u2013Nd isotopic data from these metabasic rocks define a regression line corresponding to a maximum age limit of 804 \u00b1 100 Ma and Nd = 7.37 \u00b1 0.55. Mafic to intermediate plutonic rocks of GGBC show tholeiitic to calc-alkaline evolutionary trends with LILE and LREE enrichment patterns, Y and HREE depletion, and moderately negative anomalies of Ta, Nb, and Ti, characteristic of suprasubduction zone originated magmas. U\u2013Pb zircon dates, Rb\u2013Sr whole-rock isochron, and Sm\u2013Nd mineral isochron ages of these plutonic rocks range between \u223c 750 Ma and 540 Ma, constraining the timing of island arc construction as the Neoproterozoic\u2013Early Cambrian. The Nd and Sr isotopic ratios and the model and emplacement ages of massive quartz diorites in GGBC suggest that pre-Pan African continental crust was involved in the evolution of the island arc terrane. This in turn indicates that the ANS may not be made entirely of juvenile continental crust of Neoproterozoic age. Following its separation from ANS in the Early Paleozoic, TCM underwent a period of extensive crustal growth during 330\u2013280 Ma through the emplacement of microcline granite plutons as part of a magmatic arc system above a Paleo-Tethyan subduction zone dipping beneath the southern margin of Eurasia. TCM and other peri-Gondwanan terranes exposed in a series of basement culminations within the Alpine orogenic belt provide essential information on the Pan-African history of Gondwana and the rift-drift stages of the tectonic evolution of Paleo-Tethys as a back-arc basin between Gondwana and Eurasia.",

        "abstract": "The Platreef, at the base of the northern limb of the Bushveld Complex in South Africa, hosts platinum-group element (PGE) mineralization in association with base-metal sulphides (BMS) and platinum-group minerals (PGM). However, whilst a magmatic origin of the stratiform mineralization of the upper Platreef has been widely confirmed, the processes responsible for the PGE and BMS mineralization and metasomatism of the host rocks in the Platreef are still under discussion. In order to contribute to the present discussion, we present an integrated petrographical, mineral-chemical, whole-rock trace- and major-element, sulphur- and neodymium-isotope, study of Platreef footwall clinopyroxenite drill core samples from Overysel, which is located in the northern sector of the northern Bushveld limb. A metasomatic transformation of magmatic pyroxenite units to non-magmatic clinopyroxenite is in accordance with the petrography and whole-rock chemical analysis. The whole-rock data display lower SiO2, FeO, Na2O and Cr (&lt;1700 ppm), and higher CaO, concentrations in the here-studied footwall Platreef clinopyroxenite samples than primary magmatic Platreef pyroxenite and norite. The presence of capped globular sulphides in some samples, which display differentiation into pyrrhotite and pentlandite in the lower, and chalcopyrite in the upper part, is attributed to the fractional crystallization of a sulphide liquid, and a downward transport of the blebs. In situ sulphur (V-CDT) isotope BMS data show isotopic signatures (&delta;34S = 0.9 to 3.1 &permil;; &Delta;33S = 0.09 to 0.32&permil;) close to or within the pristine magmatic range. Elevated (non-zero) &Delta;33S values are common for Bushveld magmas, indicating contamination by older, presumably crustal sulphur in an early stage chamber, whereas magmatic &delta;34S values suggest the absence of local crustal contamination during emplacement. This is in accordance with the &epsilon;Nd (2.06 Ga) (chondritic uniform reservoir (CHUR)) values, of &minus;6.16 to &minus;6.94, which are similar to those of the magmatic pyroxenite and norite of the Main Zone and the Platreef in the northern sector of the northern Bushveld limb. Base-metal sulphide textures and S&ndash;Se-ratios give evidence for a secondary S-loss during late- to post-magmatic hydrothermal alteration. The textural evidence, as well as the bulk S/Se ratios and sulphide S isotopes studies, suggest that the mineralization in both the less and the pervasively hydrothermally altered clinopyroxenite samples of Overysel are of magmatic origin. This is further supported by the PPGE (Rh, Pt, Pd) concentrations in the BMS and mass-balance calculations, in both of which large proportions of the whole-rock Pd and Rh are hosted by pentlandite, whereas Pt and the IPGE (Os, Ir, Ru) were interpreted to mainly occur in discrete PGM. However, the presence of pentlandite with variable PGE concentrations on the thin section scale may be related to variations in the S content, already at S-saturation during magmatic formation, and/or post-solidification mobilization and redistribution.",

        "abstract": "An alkali-rich set of dykes near Freestone, eastern Victoria (Australia) has an age and geochemical signature similar to alkali basalts in western Victoria, which are found interbedded with low-Ti tholeiites of the Ferrar magmatic province. Both occurrences of alkali basalts are shown to have EM1 mantle-type trace element and Nd isotopic signatures, while the Sr isotopic signature in the Freestone basalts is likely to have been affected by secondary processes. The Jurassic alkali basalts are also similar to the Cenozoic alkali basalts of the Newer Volcanic Province in West Victoria. This suggests that the source for both the Jurassic and Cenozoic alkali basalts may have resided in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle. This has also been suggested as the source for the low-Ti tholeiites, which are likely to have come from a shallower part of the lithosphere than the alkali basalts. Alternatively, both the Jurassic and Cenozoic alkali basalts could have had a plume source, in which case the geochemical similarity between these two periods of magmatism is presumably coincidental.Un faisceau de filons alcalins pr\u00e8s de Freestone (Australie) poss\u00e8de un \u00e2ge et une signature g\u00e9ochimique semblables aux basaltes alcalins de Victoria occidental, qui sont interstratifi\u00e9s avec les thol\u00e9ites de la province magmatique de Ferrar. Ces deux occurrences de basaltes alcalins poss\u00e9dent une signature EM1 sur la base des \u00e9l\u00e9ments en traces et des isotopes du Nd; les isotopes du Sr des basaltes de Freestone ont probablement \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s par des processus secondaires. Les basaltes alcalins jurassiques sont \u00e9galement semblables aux basaltes c\u00e9nozo\u00efques de la province volcanique nouvelle en Victoria occidental. Ceci sugg\u00e8re que les sources des basaltes jurassiques et c\u00e9nozo\u00efques ont toutes les deux r\u00e9sid\u00e9s dans le manteau lithosph\u00e9rique sous-continental. Cette source a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 envisag\u00e9e pour les thol\u00e9ites pauvres en Ti, qui provinrent probablement d'une partie moins profonde de la lithosph\u00e8re que les basaltes alcalins. Alternativement, aussi bien les basaltes jurassiques que c\u00e9nozo\u00efques pourraient avoir une source de type panache mantellique, auquel cas la similitude g\u00e9ochimique entre ces deux p\u00e9riodes de magmatisme est purement une co\u00efncidence.",

        "abstract": "An origin of the Tinaquillo Peridotite Complex in northern Venezuela, and a model for the tectonic framework of the boundary zone between the southern Caribbean Plate margin and the South American Plate (SAP) during Late Jurassic to Mid-Cretaceous time are developed using newly measured Sr, Nd, Pb and Hf isotopic compositions as well as major and trace element geochemistry for some hornblendite veins and their spinel peridotite host rocks. Depleted geochemical characteristics, principally major element concentrations, and Nd and Hf isotopes (e.g., \u03b5Nd = + 27; \u03b5Hf = +50; ca. 3.4 Ga-Nd model age) of the Tinaquillo peridotites suggest a genetic link between this complex and the Guiana Shield farther to the south within Venezuela. Scattered zones within the Tinaquillo peridotite were overprinted by what we interpret as channelized hydrous fluids (<\u223c3%) derived from the eastward-dipping subduction of the Farallon Plate beneath the SAP in the Late Jurassic, leading to modification of the original Sr, Nd and Hf isotopic compositions as well as the incompatible element concentrations. The hornblendite veins have Sr, Nd, Pb and Hf isotopic compositions, falling within the range of present-day Pacific/Atlantic MORB, but trace element abundance patterns with combinations of arc- and MORB-like characteristics. These results rule out the possibility of local melting of the host peridotites to produce magmas from which the hornblendite veins formed. We suggest that during inception of the westward-dipping subduction of the Protocaribbean Plate immediately following polarity reversal in the Mid-Cretaceous, melts infiltrated the mantle lithosphere and produced the veins.",

        "abstract": "Geodynamic models, geological-geophysical interpretations, and isotope analysis illustrate that there are links between the nickel and gold mineral systems in the Halls Creek Orogen, Western Australia. Whole-rock Nd and Ar/Ar analysis of rocks throughout the region, when compared with the geodynamic models suggest that nickel and gold mineralization in the Halls Creek Orogen can be related to basin development and subsequent basin closure during the convergence of North Australian Craton and Kimberley Craton, respectively. Whole-rock Nd analysis confirmed the input of juvenile melts in the centre of the orogen before the 1835\u20131805 Ma Halls Creek Orogeny, supporting the upwelling of decompression mantle melts during the basin development. These analyses also revealed the spatial links between nickel and gold mineralization and lithological units with positive \u03b5Nd values. Spatially the link between these mineral systems appears to be related to the presence of deep-seated shear zones that formed early in the history of the orogen and were later reactivated. The results of geodynamic models, geophysical interpretation, and isotopic analysis are used to understand the critical processes in the gold and nickel mineralization, which are presented by predictor maps. The GIS-based knowledge-driven fuzzy logic method used to integrate the predictor maps and create the prospectivity maps. Herein we show that mafic-ultramafic units prospective for nickel mineralization formed by upwelling of decompression mantle melt during crustal thinning and extension during basin development, and typically consist of the most juvenile magmas in the region. Whereas, gold deposits formed during the compressional regime and basin closure, and are located along a major shear zone separating two terranes. This deep crustal-scale shear zone is implied to be the site of multiple stages of deformation that acted as fluid migration pathways during basin closure and subsequent collision. Another critical element that appears to be related to gold prospectivity is the presence of lithologies with a juvenile signature. In contrast to nickel analyses which are closely related to mafic-ultramafic units, the source component seems less influential when attempting to target orogenic gold deposits.",

        "abstract": "The early Paleozoic orogen in South China Block is an intracontinental orogen, and synchronous magmatism (440\u2013390 Ma) is mainly acidic with minor intermediate-mafic magmatism. Previous studies suggest that most of the early Paleozoic granites in South China belong to peraluminous S-type genesis while amphibole-bearing I-type granites are subordinate. However, our results indicate that considerable amounts of these early Paleozoic granites have characteristics of both S- and I-type granites. Thus, we propose to divide these granites into two groups: fewer of them are Group A with relatively high () values (clustering within \u2212 3.0 to + 9.0) and () values (\u2212 5.2 to + 1.3) as well as higher initial temperatures at 810\u2013850 \u00b0C, and most of them are Group B with relatively low () values (clustering within \u2212 16.0 to \u2212 1.0) and () values (\u2212 13.2 to \u2212 4.1) as well as relatively low initial temperatures at 700\u2013830 \u00b0C. The Xiawan monzogranite and Duntou granodiorite are typical Group A granitoids and yield zircon U\u2013Pb ages of ca. 410 Ma. These two granites are characterized by high SiO (between 67.59 and 74.87 wt.%), metaluminous to peraluminous (A/CNK = 0.96\u20131.48) compositions, and a negative correlation between PO and SiO. Their biotites belong to magnesium biotites, indicating that they have partial features of either I- or S-type granites. Duntou granodiorites exhibit higher () values (clustering within + 1 to + 8) and () values (\u2212 3.0 to + 1.1) while Xiawan monzogranites show relatively low () values (clustering within \u2212 1 to + 5) and () values (\u2212 5.0 to \u2212 3.7). Group B granitoids are represented by the Miao'ershan\u2013Yuechengling batholith, which are characterized by high SiO (between 64.57 and 77.37 wt.%), metaluminous compositions (A/CNK = 0.90\u20131.24), and a negative correlation between PO and SiO. Yuechengling porphyritic amphibole-bearing biotite granites in this batholith contain abundant amphibole, indicating that they are I-type granites. Miao'ershan\u2013Yuechengling batholith also exhibits relatively low () values (\u2212 12.7 to \u2212 1.8) and () values (\u2212 8.9 to \u2212 6.7).Geochemical and isotopic analyses on early Paleozoic granites, mafic enclaves and mafic to intermediate rocks demonstrate that the Group A granitoids including Xiawan and Duntou granites may be generated by AFC processes with interactions between asthenosphere-derived magma and metasedimentary rocks, and the Group B granitoids may be formed by AFC processes with interactions between synchronous basaltic magma and metamorphic basement. The post-collisional delamination and asthenospheric upwelling directly participate in the generation of Group A granitoids but indirectly induce the formation of Group B granitoids.",

        "abstract": "New major and trace element abundances, and Pb, Sr, and Nd isotopic ratios of Quaternary lavas from two adjacent volcanoes (South Pagan and the Central Volcanic Region, or CVR) located on Pagan Island allow us to investigate the mantle source (i.e., slab components) and melting dynamics within the Mariana intra-oceanic arc. Geologic mapping reveals a pre-caldera (780\u20139.4 ka) and post-caldera (<9.4 ka) eruptive stage for South Pagan, whereas the eruptive history of the older CVR is poorly constrained. Crystal fractionation and magma mixing were important crustal processes for lavas from both volcanoes. Geochemical and isotopic variations indicate that South Pagan and CVR lavas, and lavas from the northern volcano on the island, Mt. Pagan, originated from compositionally distinct parental magmas due to variations in slab contributions (sediment and aqueous fluid) to the mantle wedge and the extent of mantle partial melting. A mixing model based on Pb and Nd isotopic ratios suggests that the average amount of sediment in the source of CVR (~2.1%) and South Pagan (~1.8%) lavas is slightly higher than Mt. Pagan (~1.4%) lavas. These estimates span the range of sediment-poor Guguan (~1.3%) and sediment-rich Agrigan (~2.0%) lavas for the Mariana arc. Melt modeling demonstrates that the saucer-shaped normalized rare earth element (REE) patterns observed in Pagan lavas can arise from partial melting of a mixed source of depleted mantle and enriched sediment, and do not require amphibole interaction or fractionation to depress the middle REE abundances of the lavas. The modeled degree of mantle partial melting for Agrigan (2\u20135%), Pagan (3\u20137%), and Guguan (9\u201315%) lavas correlates with indicators of fluid addition (e.g., Ba/Th). This relationship suggests that the fluid flux to the mantle wedge is the dominant control on the extent of partial melting beneath Mariana arc volcanoes. A decrease in the amount of fluid addition (lower Ba/Th) and extent of melting (higher Sm/Yb), and an increase in the sediment contribution (higher Th/Nb, La/Sm, and Pb isotopic ratios) from Mt. Pagan to South Pagan could reflect systematic cross-arc or irregular along-arc melting variations. These observations indicate that the length scale of compositional heterogeneity in the mantle wedge beneath Mariana arc volcanoes is small (~10 km).",

Perovskites of Sung Valley dunite, ijolite and uncompahgrite yielded U\u2013Pb ages of 109.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.6, 104.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.3 and 101.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.6\u202fMa, respectively. A U\u2013Pb age of 106.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.5\u202fMa was obtained on zircons of a Sung Valley nepheline syenite. Perovskite of a Jasra clinopyroxenite yielded an age of 101.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.2\u202fMa, different from the U\u2013Pb age of 106.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8\u202fMa on zircon of Jasra syenites.

Calcite and apatite in the carbonatites, the perovskite in a dunite, and the bulk-rock carbonatites of Sung Valley intrusion have the lowest initial Sr/Sr and \u03b5, taken to be the best proxies of the mantle source composition, which is dominated by components derived from the lithospheric mantle. The alkaline intrusions of north-eastern India are significantly younger than the Sylhet tholeiitic magmatism. The silicate rocks of both intrusions have isotopic composition trending to that of the underlying Shillong crust, indicating the effects of fractional crystallization and low-pressure crustal contamination during the emplacement of the various intrusive magma pulses.",

        "abstract": "The shift of lava geochemistry between volcanic front to rear-arc volcanoes in active subduction zones is a widespread phenomenon. It is somehow linked to an increase of the slab surface depth of the subducting oceanic lithosphere and increasing thickness of the mantle wedge and new constraints for its causes may improve our understanding of magma generation and element recycling in subduction zones in general. As a case study, this paper focuses on the geochemical composition of lavas from two adjacent volcanic centres from the volcanic front (VF) to rear-arc (RA) transition of the Southern Kamchatkan subduction zone, with the aim to examine whether the shift in lava geochemistry is associated with processes in the mantle wedge or in the subducted oceanic lithosphere or both. The trace element and O\u2013Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Hf\u2013Pb (double-spike)-isotopic composition of the mafic Mutnovsky (VF) and Gorely (RA) lavas in conjunction with geochemical modelling provides constraints for the degree of partial melting in the mantle wedge and the nature of their slab components. Degrees of partial melting are inferred to be significantly higher beneath Mutnovsky (\u223c18%) than Gorely (\u223c10%). The Mutnovsky (VF) slab component is dominated by hydrous fluids, derived from subducted sediments and altered oceanic crust, eventually containing minor but variable amounts of sediment melts. The composition of the Gorely slab component strongly points to a hydrous silicate melt, most likely mainly stemming from subducted sediments, although additional fluid-contribution from the underlying altered oceanic crust (AOC) is likely. Moreover, the Hf\u2013Nd-isotope data combined with geochemical modelling suggest progressive break-down of accessory zircon in the melting metasediments. Therefore, the drastic VF to RA shift in basalt chemistry mainly arises from the transition of the nature of the slab component (from hydrous fluid to melt) in conjunction with decreasing degrees of partial melting within \u223c15 km across-arc. Finally, systematic variations of key inter-element with high-precision Pb-isotope ratios provide geochemical evidence for a pollution of the Mutnovsky mantle source with Gorely melt components but not vice versa, most likely resulting from trench-ward mantle wedge corner flow. We also present a geodynamic model integrating the location of the Mutnovsky and Gorely volcanic centres and their lava geochemistry with the recently proposed thermal structure of the southern Kamchatkan arc and constraints about phase equilibria in subducted sediments and AOC. Herein, the slab surface hosting the subducted sediments suffers a transition from dehydration to melting above a continuously dehydrating layer of AOC. Wider implications of this study are that an onset of (flush-) sediment melting may ultimately be the main trigger for the VF to RA transition of lava geochemistry in subduction zones.",

        "abstract": "The Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic compositions for the Kovdor phoscorite\u2013carbonatite complex (PCC), Kola Peninsula, NW Russia, have been determined to characterize the mantle sources involved and to evaluate the relative contributions of a plume and subcontinental lithospheric mantle in the formation of the complex. The Kovdor PCC is a part of the Kovdor ultramafic\u2013alkaline\u2013carbonatite massif, and consists of six intrusions. The initial isotopic ratios of the analyzed samples, calculated at 380 Ma, display limited variations: , + 2.0 to + 4.7; Sr/Sr, 0.70319 to 0.70361 (, \u2212 12.2 to \u2212 6.2); Pb/Pb, 18.38 to 18.74; Pb/Pb, 15.45 to 15.50; Pb/Pb, 37.98 to 39.28. The Nd and Sr isotope data of the Kovdor PCC generally fit the patterns of the other phoscorites and carbonatites from the Kola Alkaline Province (KAP), but some data are slightly shifted from the mixing line defined as the Kola Carbonatite Line, having more radiogenic Sr/Sr ratios. However, the less radiogenic Nd isotopic compositions and negative \u03947/4 values of Pb isotopes of the analyzed samples exclude crustal contamination, but imply the involvement of a metasomatized lithospheric mantle source. Isotopic variations indicate mixing of at least three distinct mantle components: FOZO-like primitive plume component, EMI-like enriched component and DMM-like depleted component. The isotopic nature of the EMI- and DMM-like mantle component observed in the Kovdor samples is considered to be inherited from metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle. This supports the previous models invoking plume\u2013lithosphere interaction to explain the origin of the Devonian alkaline carbonatite magmatism in the KAP.",

        "abstract": "Isotope data and trace elements concentrations are presented for volcanic and plutonic rocks from the Livingston, Greenwich, Robert, King George and Ardley islands (South Shetland arc, Antarctica). These islands were formed during subduction of the Phoenix Plate under the Antarctica Plate from Cretaceous to Tertiary. Isotopically (Sr/Sr) ratios vary from 0.7033 to 0.7046 and (Nd/Nd) ratios from 0.5127 to 0.5129. \u03b5Nd values vary from +2.71 to +7.30 that indicate asthenospheric mantle source for the analysed samples. Pb/Pb ratios vary from 38.12 to 38.70, Pb/Pb ratios are between 15.49 and 15.68, and Pb/Pb from 18.28 to 18.81. The South Shetland rocks are thought to be derived from a depleted MORB mantle source (DMM) modified by mixtures of two enriched mantle components such as slab-derived melts and/or fluids and small fractions of oceanic sediment (EM I and EM II). The isotopic compositions of the subduction component can be explained by mixing between at least 4 wt.% of sediment and 96 wt.% of melts and/or fluids derived from altered MORB.",

        "abstract": "Evolution of the lithospheric mantle beneath the North China Craton (NCC) from its Precambrian cratonic architecture until Paleozoic, and the transformation to an oceanic realm during Mesozoic, with implications on the destruction of cratonic root have attracted global attention. Here we present geochemical and isotopic data on a suite of newly identified Mesozoic mafic dyke swarms from the Longwangmiao, Weijiazhuang, Mengjiazhuang, Jiayou, Huangmi, and Xiahonghe areas (Qianhuai Block) along the eastern NCC with an attempt to gain further insights on the lithospheric evolution of the region. The Longwangmiao dykes are alkaline with LILE (Ba and K)- and LREE-enrichment ((La/Yb) 4.3) and EM1-like Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic signature ((Sr/Sr) 0.706; \u03b5 (t) < \u22126.3, (Pb/Pb) > 16.6, (Pb/Pb) 15.4, (Pb/Pb) 36.8, \u03b5 (t) < \u221222.4). The Weijiazhuang dykes are sub-alkaline with LILE (Ba and K)- and LREE-enrichment ((La/Yb) > 3.7), and display similar EM1-like isotopic features ((Sr/Sr) 0.706; \u03b5 (t) < \u22127.0, (Pb/Pb) > 16.7, (Pb/Pb) 15.4, (Pb/Pb) 36.9, \u03b5 (t) < \u221223.3). The Mengjiazhuang dykes are also sub-alkaline with LILE (Ba and K)- and LREE-enrichment ((La/Yb) > 2.4) and EM1-like isotopic features((Sr/Sr) 0.706; \u03b5 (t) < \u221218.4, (Pb/Pb) > 16.7, (Pb/Pb) 15.4, (Pb/Pb) 36.9, \u03b5 (t) < \u22128.6). The Jiayou dykes also display sub-alkaline affinity with LILE (Ba and K)- and LREE-enrichment ((La/Yb) > 3.7) and EM1-like Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic features ((Sr/Sr) 0.706; \u03b5 (t) < \u221215.3, (Pb/Pb) > 16.7, (Pb/Pb) 15.4, (Pb/Pb) 36.9, \u03b5 (t) < \u221218.4). The Huangmi dykes are alkaline (with NaO + KO ranging to more than 5.9 wt.%)) with LILE (Ba and K)- and LREE-enrichment ((La/Yb) > 9.3) and EM1-like isotopic composition ((Sr/Sr) 0.705; \u03b5 (t) < \u221215.1, (Pb/Pb) > 16.9, (Pb/Pb) 15.5, (Pb/Pb) 36.9, \u03b5 (t) < \u221212.2). The Xiahonghe dykes are alkaline with LILE (Ba and K)- and LREE-enrichment ((La/Yb) = 2.12-2.84) and similar EM1-like Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic signature ((Sr/Sr) > 0.705; \u03b5 (t)<-18.0, (Pb/Pb) > 16.9, (Pb/Pb) 15.5, (Pb/Pb) 36.9, \u03b5 (t) < \u22128.6). Our data from the various mafic dyke suites suggest that the magmas were derived from EM1-like lithospheric mantle, corresponding to lithospheric mantle modified by the previously foundered lower crust beneath the eastern NCC. Our results suggest contrasting lithospheric evolution from Triassic (212 Ma) to Cretaceous (123 Ma) beneath the NCC. These mafic dykes mark an important phase of lithospheric thinning in the eastern North China Craton.",

        "abstract": "Late Paleozoic tectonic links between Luliang Uplift and the adjacent West Junggar terrane remain poorly understood, despite their significant implications for the tectonic reconstruction of Junggar terrane and its role in the evolution of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. The western Luliang Uplift offers a critical window to address this problem. In this study, based on seismic profiles and geophysical interpretation of the western Luliang Uplift, and from new geochronological and geochemical data, we evaluate the tectonostratigraphic evolution of the region. The western Luliang Uplift is composed of Carboniferous basalt, andesite and dacite interbedded with multiple layers of siltstone and mudstone. Zircon U\u2013Pb isotopic data indicate that these rocks coevally erupted in 323\u2013327 Ma. Seismic profile across the tectonic belt shows that the western Luliang Uplift experienced a structural inversion from Carboniferous extension to latest Carboniferous\u2013Early Permian compression. The basalts and andesites show tholeiitic to calc-alkaline affinity, high \u03b5(t) (6.4\u20138.0) and low initial Sr/Sr (0.703497\u20130.704826), relative enrichment in LILEs and REEs, and depletion in HFSEs, especially Nb, Ta and Ti. The dacites show arc-like geochemical characteristics comparable with I-type granite, and positive \u03b5(t) (4.8\u20134.9) and \u03b5(t) (4.1\u20139.9) values. These features indicate that the basaltic rocks and dacites were derived from partial melting of a depleted mantle modified by slab-derived fluids and a juvenile lower crust respectively in an island arc environment during the Early Carboniferous. Furthermore, these coeval volcanic rocks show a temporal variation of tholeiitic to calc-alkaline series in the south to calc-alkaline to shoshonitic series in the north, together with extensional deformation and formation of the volcano-sedimentary sequence. These features suggest that the western Luliang Uplift was dominated by northward subduction with forearc and intra-arc basin in the Early Carboniferous. The Middle Permian terrigenous strata unconformably overlie the Early Carboniferous strata, indicating that the ocean basin might have closed during the Early Permian. Similarities in the tectonostratigraphic evolution show that the western Luliang Uplift and southern West Junggar terrane share a common tectonic evolution from Carboniferous subduction\u2013accretion process to Early Permian amalgamation, further confirming the Luliang Uplift as an important link between the East and West Junggar terranes.",

        "abstract": "Lavas and subvolcanic intrusions of the 1.87 Ga Brockman volcanics comprise a cogenetic suite of alkaline,Qz-normative, metaluminous trachyandesites, trachytes and trachydacites/rhyolites. They are genetically related to the rare-metal-bearing \u201cNiobium Tuff\u201d which contains extreme enrichments in high-field-strength incompatible elements (av. 1660 ppm Y, 9700 ppm Zr, 3200 ppm Nb, 175 ppm Yb). Neodymium isotopic data indicate the Brockman parent magma was mantle-derived with \u03b5Nd(initial) + 3, analogous to basaltic magmas generated in some modern intraplate \u201chot-spot\u201d volcanic provinces. The geochemical evolution and incompatible element enrichments in the Brockman suite can be modelled by AFC processes involving extensive degrees of crystallization and progressive contamination of derivative magmas with granitic/ metasedimentary upper crust. The large degrees of crystallization required to derive the more differentiated members of the Brockman suite are best accommodated by a process of \u201cliquid fractionation\u201d resulting in internal compositional stratification of the magma chamber with extreme differentiates such as the Niobium Tuff forming a volatile-enriched \u201ccap\u201d in the magma chamber roof-zone. The high fluorine content of the Brockman magmas played a crucial role in enhancing rare-metal contents by increasing the efficiency of crystal-liquid separation and decreasing mineral-melt Kd's. There appears to be no special role for fluorine-rich fluids in generating the rare-metal enrichments. However, leaching of fluorocarbonate minerals by late hydrothermal solutions, rather than fractionation of a LREE-selective phase, caused marked LREE-depletion in the Niobium Tuff.",

        "abstract": "New geochemical and Sr\u2013Nd isotopic data for the Iratsu eclogite and surrounding metamorphic rocks of the Sanbagawa belt, Japan, show that, while the protoliths of the metamorphic rocks formed in a variety of tectonic settings, the Iratsu body represents a deeply subducted and accreted island arc. The igneous protoliths of eclogites and garnet amphibolites were probably generated from a mantle source that had components of both a depleted mantle modified by slab-released fluid (as seen in a negative Nb anomaly) and an enriched mantle, similar to that of ocean island basalts (OIB). Fractional crystallization modeling indicates that the protoliths of some garnet clinopyroxenites from the Iratsu body are cumulates from a basaltic magma that crystallized under high O and HO fugacities in the middle to lower crust. The source characteristics and crystallization conditions suggest that the protoliths of the Iratsu rocks formed in an oceanic island arc. Quartz eclogites from the marginal zone of the Iratsu body have geochemical signatures similar to turbidites from the Izu\u2013Bonin island arc (as seen in a negative Nb anomaly and a concave REE pattern). The protoliths might be volcaniclastic turbidites that formed in a setting proximal to the oceanic island arc. Geochemical and isotopic signatures of the surrounding mafic schists are similar to normal (N-) and enriched (E-) mid-ocean-ridge basalt (MORB), and distinct from the rocks from the Iratsu body. The protoliths of the mafic schists likely formed in a plume-influenced mid-ocean ridge or back-arc basin. Pelitic schists from the surrounding rocks and pelitic gneisses from the marginal zone of the Iratsu body have evolved, continental geochemical signatures (as seen in a negative \u03b5(t) value (~\u22125)), consistent with their origin as continent-derived trench-fill turbidites.\u25ba The Sanbagawa belt has several eclogite bodies, including the Iratsu body. \u25ba New geochemical and Sr-Nd isotopic data for the Iratsu eclogites are presented. \u25ba The Iratsu body represents a deeply subducted and accreted island arc.",

        "abstract": "Isotopic patterns of Nd, Sr, and Pb are remarkably coherent along the super-fast spreading portion of the East Pacific Rise from 13\u00b0S to 23\u00b0S. Between 15.8\u00b0S and 20.7\u00b0S, all three define a broad, smooth peak, which culminates at \u223c 17\u201317.5\u00b0S and is characterized by elevated , , and lower (reaching values of 0.70271, 18.64, and +8.9, respectively). To the north and south this peak is flanked by \u223c 300 km long, isotopically homogeneous sections of ridge with higher (\u223c +10.9) and lower (\u223c 0.7024) and (\u223c 18.1). Although otherwise similar, these two sections differ from each other slightly in their and ratios. The isotopic peak corresponds to a region of greater axial cross-sectional area, but axial bathymetry and physical segmentation appear generally unrelated to mantle isotopic composition. However, an abrupt break in isotopic ratios does occur at the large, > 3 Ma, southward-propagating overlapping spreading center at 20.7\u00b0S, which marks the end of the south limb or flank of the isotopic peak. The peak itself appears to be a manifestation of large-scale binary mixing between material possessing at least mildly plume-like Nd, Pb, and Sr isotopic characteristics (most abundant at \u223c 17\u201317.5\u00b0S) and two slightly different high- mantle end-members equivalent to those north of 15.8\u00b0S and south of 20.7\u00b0S. Helium isotopes also define a prominent along-axis peak, but it spans a much narrower range of latitude and is offset slightly to the north of those for Nd, Sr and Pb isotopes. The combined results suggest that a discrete mantle heterogeneity may be entering into the melt zone near 15.8\u00b0S and migrating southward as far as the 20.7\u00b0S overlapping spreading center.Isotopic variability at short length scales is very limited throughout the entire 13\u201323\u00b0S region. It cannot be solely a result of homogenization by petrogenetic processes, because there is a lack of corresponding uniformity in ratios of highly to moderately incompatible elements; also, isotopes do not correlate with major element indicators of degree of partial melting or differentiation, or, in general, with the secondary magmatic segmentation thought to reflect different partial melting domains. Therefore, the subaxial mantle must be isotopically well-mixed relative to the scale of melting. In part, this probably reflects: (1) a larger of melting per unit length of ridge; and (2) a greater flow of mantle into the subaxial melt zone at super-fast spreading; but also must represent (3) a reduced amount of real isotopic variability in the shallow asthenosphere, as emphasized by the regional isotopic uniformity north and south of the isotopic peak. Such large-scale homogeneity could be a result of enhanced convective asthenospheric mixing over a long period of time. It could also reflect a low, long-term input of continental, lithospheric, recycled slab, or plume-type material into the regional asthenosphere.Largely independent of the north-south isotopic patterns is a fairly regular, southward depletion in highly incompatible elements such as Rb and Nb, superimposed on which is sizable local variability. Because ratios of highly to moderately incompatible elements show little or no correlation with major-element indicators of degree of melting, much of the variation in highly incompatible elements must be caused by a different (probably larger) volume of mantle than that conferring the major element signatures, or by one (or more) event that preceded the main melting episode in the not too ancient past.",

        "abstract": "The Shalair area, which is located in northeastern Iraq, is considered to be part of the northern Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone (SaSZ) and contains several granitoid bodies. One of these bodies, the Mishao porphyritic-granite (MG), was crystallized at 111.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.4 Ma, based on its zircon U-Pb age. Its geochemical characteristics suggest that the MG rocks are calc-alkaline, peraluminous, I-type granites with microgranular mafic enclaves. They are enriched in SiO, NaO, AlO and Zr and depleted in MgO, FeO, Nb and Ti; in contrast, the enclave sample records lower SiO content and higher contents of MgO and FeO. These rocks show an enrichment of LREE relative to HREE, and pronounced negative Eu anomalies implying feldspar fractionation. The isotopic and geochemical characteristics of the MG samples suggest that these rocks are evolved through fractional crystallization. In the La/Nb-Nb diagram and Sm/Nd ratios, the MG rocks and the enclave samples exhibit strong evidence for crustal contamination. The MG rocks record high initial Sr/Sr (0.70625\u20130.70740) and low Nd/Nd(i) (0.51235\u20130.51274) ratios. These Sr-Nd isotopic data, combined with the presence of high Th/U and Rb/Sr ratios and significant depletions of Nb, Ta and Ti, show a relation of these bodies to an active continental margin regime. Based on the age and geochemical data of the MG, this study presents new information about the occurrence of Middle Cretaceous magmatic activities, which are related to the active continental margins in the SaSZ that run parallel to the Zagros Fold-Thrust Belt.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we report a combined zircon U\u2013Pb\u2013O isotopes and bulk-rock Sr\u2013Nd\u2013O isotopes study on granitic rocks from the J\u00e1lama pluton, Central Iberian Zone. Zircon U--Pb ages of representative granitic rock samples are bracketed in the range of 306\u2013304 \u00b1 3 Ma, but within the level 2\u03c3 errors of U--Pb ages. Therefore it is not possible to establish differences in intrusion ages between the main granitic units that make up the J\u00e1lama pluton. Microgranular enclaves appear to be slightly older (309 \u00b1 2 Ma), but they do overlap with the age of the granitic rocks. Sr--Nd isotopic data for enclaves of tonalitic composition preclude a simple mantle or crustal origin, but high mean zircon O values of 8.65 \u00b1 0.9\u2030 and \u03b4O(WR) values of 9.96\u201310.56\u2030 reflect a largely crustally contaminated magma. The combination of field relations, petrography, bulk-rock geochemistry, Sr-Nd-O isotopic data, zircon \u03b4O values and U--Pb ages provide compelling evidence that the granites from the J\u00e1lama pluton: (i) were coevally formed involving assimilation and mingling/mixing concomitant to fractional crystallization; and (ii) represent typical S-type granites that evolved from a same crustal source, potentially metasedimentary rocks from the Schist Greywacke Complex by considering the Neoproterozoic ages of the inherited zircons.",

        "abstract": "Neogene igneous activity in the Aegean region comprised both extrusive volcanism and intrusive granitoid plutonism. Granitoid plutonism in the Cyclades was established in the mid-Miocene period and lasted until late Miocene (18 to 9 Ma). The timing of granitoid intrusion was associated with the initiation of extensional tectonics in the Aegean. These intrusions form a broad belt about 200 km long running from the west (Lavrium and Serifos) to the eastern Aegean. Both S-type and I-type granitoids are present, the former generally being emplaced earlier than the I-types (~ 15 to 8.3 Ma). Major and trace element variations reveal that three end-member components are involved in the granitoids, but the proportions of these vary in the different plutons. Initial isotopic compositions of all the granitoids are typical of crust-derived magmas from heterogeneous metasedimentary sources (I-type: Sr/Sr = 0.7091\u20130.712, = \u2212 6.4 to \u2212 10.4; S-type: 0.710\u20130715, = \u2212 7.5 to \u2212 10.1). Three end-member sources have been identified: 1) One end-member appears to be a metasedimentary biotite-gneiss (greywacke-type) such as that forming the metamorphic core complexes (Naxos and Paros); this is a dominant (but not the only) component in the S-types. 2a) Major, trace element and Sr\u2013Nd isotopic composition correlations of the S-type granitoids with basement gneiss require an extra source of Sr and Ca, having lower initial Sr/Sr indicating a more depleted metasedimentary source at depth, due to possible interaction, of metamorphic fluids with marbles and amphibolites and infiltration through the gneissic units, at mid-crustal levels. 2b) A possible second end-member could be the marble component, as indicated by the buffered values of the Initial Sr isotopic ratios. Major element variation of the mafic microgranular (quartz diorites and tonalites) enclaves are compatible with dehydration melting of a mafic source similar to the amphibolites (island arc tholeiites) at medium pressure (~ 8 kb) conditions. 3) Amphibolite is another end-member which may contribute mostly to the source of the younger intrusions, along the western flank of the arc.",

        "abstract": "Isotopic analyses of Miocene comenditic, pantelleritic, and trachyphonolitic ignimbrites and lavas from Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, provide evidence for posteruptive mobility of Rb, Sr, and O. Calculated initial ratios in whole-rock samples from basaltic lavas and feldspar mineral separates from ignimbrites define a magmatic trend in the stratigraphic section, from ratios of 0.70340 at the base of the Mogan Formation to 0.70305 in the lower Fataga Formation. However, calculated apparent initial ratios in hydrated vitrophyre and devitrified matrix separates range from 0.7035 to 0.7090. ratios in basalts and feldspars vary little, from +5.7 to +6.1, yet range from +6.5 to +15.0 in the ignimbrite matrices. In contrast to the Sr and O isotope ratios, Pb and Nd isotope ratios are identical within analytical error in feldspars and their silicic ignimbrite matrices. Sequential leaching experiments and the oxygen data suggest that low-temperature, posteruptive interaction with meteoric water, perhaps containing a small seawater component, has modified Rb and Sr concentrations in the matrices, such that calculated apparent initial ratios are not those of the magmas when they were erupted. Mobilization of Rb and Sr must occur significantly after eruption. Nd and Pb isotope systems appear to be unaffected by this process. Therefore, ratios determined by whole rock analysis of silicic rocks from hotspottype oceanic islands are suspect and should not be incorporated into mantle tracer studies, although analysis of phenocrysts may produce useful data.",

        "abstract": "The mantle xenolith suite from Tallante (Betic Cordillera, southern Spain) comprises peridotites equilibrated in the spinel to plagioclase stability field, ranging in composition from fertile lherzolites to harzburgites residual after partial melting events that occurred in pre-Paleozoic times. Evidence of superimposed metasomatic effects can be attributed to at least two metasomatizing agents with distinct chemical and isotopic compositions. The first was a silica-undersaturated alkaline melt, resulting in variable Light Rare Earth Elements (LREE) and Sr\u2013Nd isotopic enrichment (Sr/Sr=0.70213\u20130.70476; Nd/Nd=0.51339\u20130.51250) from Depleted Mantle (DM) to Enriched Mantle (EMI) end-members. This predominant metasomatism did not form hydrous phases, secondary textures, or significant mineralogical changes, and appears to be compositionally analogous to that recorded in xenoliths and Alpine peridotite massifs of the Southern European lithospheric mantle. The second metasomatic agent was a silica-oversaturated hydrous melt, producing local (<5\u201310%) mantle hybridization, with the formation of amphibole/phlogopite-bearing opx-rich harzburgites containing olivine\u2013orthopyroxenite and gabbronorite lenses. This metasomatism is characterized by Sr\u2013Nd isotopic values representing the most extreme enriched signature (Sr/Sr=0.70672\u20130.70856; Nd/Nd=0.51213\u20130.51211) found in uncontaminated anorogenic basic magmas and associated mantle xenoliths throughout Europe. These Sr\u2013Nd isotopic data closely approach those recorded in the Miocene calc-alkaline and potassic volcanism of the Betic Cordillera, suggesting that this signature could have been inherited from subduction-derived metasomatizing melts during the Tertiary orogenic events of the Betic\u2013Alboran region. The incompatible element distribution of these xenoliths and their constituent pyroxenes is also quite unusual, showing chondrite-normalized upward convex Middle (M)REE patterns coupled with remarkable negative Sr and Eu anomalies. Incompatible element modeling indicates that the peculiar composition of clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and plagioclase can be accounted for by the interaction between the peridotite matrix and potassic silica-oversaturated melts, approaching lamproites found in the Betic Cordillera. A comparison with analogous worldwide occurrences indicates that some distinctive characteristics of subduction-related metasomatism in mantle materials are (1) silica-oversaturation in the form of excess orthopyroxene crystallization, in association with hydrous phases; (2) high Sr/Sr ratios, departing from the anorogenic mantle array; (3) particularly high Sr/Sr and low Nd/Nd ratios, coupled with strong negative Sr and Eu anomalies, indicating a significant contribution of continental terrigenous components in the source of subduction-related metasomatizing agents.",

        "abstract": "Dyke emplacement in the course of Paran\u00e1-Etendeka volcanism in northwestern Namibia has been considered as a short-lived event related to a specific magma source at approximately 135\u2013130 Ma. New geochemical, whole rock Sr-Nd-Pb isotope data and Ar/Ar ages reveal that at least three geochemically and isotopically different tholeiitic dyke generations, with intrusion ages of 135.2 \u00b1 0.7, 124.1 \u00b1 0.8 Ma and 113.0 \u00b1 0.5 Ma, can be distinguished in the M\u00f6we Bay area, Skeleton Coast of northwestern Namibia. Distinct mantle source components were identified in the petrogenesis of the various dyke generations. Magma composition of the two older dyke suites, both of which were emplaced in a tectonic setting dominated by E-W extension, evolved from a within-plate to an enriched mid-ocean ridge basalt type. Contamination by continental crust and/or lithospheric mantel is suggested by a high U/Pb-value (= \u03bc) of 9.97, which is typical of the Kalahari Craton. The third dyke generation, which intruded in a tectonic regime dominated by SE-NW extension, corresponds to high-Ti ocean island-type basalt with unradiogenic isotopic compositions derived from a mantle source with a \u03bc-value of 9.35.The formation of the older dykes is attributed to the presence of a thermal anomaly in the upper sublithospheric mantle. This anomaly was most likely caused by the peripheral part of a mantle plume that impinged at the base of the lithosphere and caused erosion of the subcontinental mantle lithosphere and melting above the plume head. The initial break-up of SW Gondwana and the formation of early oceanic crust were most likely due to passive rather than active rifting. Continued plume upwelling facilitated by progressive thinning of SW-Gondwana crust led to the formation of the younger, c. 113 Ma old dykes, which are chemically and isotopically identical to coeval rocks from the northeastern portion of the Walvis Ridge and thus are interpreted as onshore expressions of the Tristan-Gough plume head at that time. The difference in the dominant extension directions of the older and the younger dyke generations can be explained by rotation induced by the Aptian/Albian opening of the Equatorial Central Atlantic, accompanied by a substantial increase in the South Atlantic spreading rate.",

        "abstract": "The Karacada\u011f (Kulu-Konya) area is one of the main volcanic provinces in Central Anatolia. The Karacada\u011f volcanites are composed of large volumes of andesitic-dacitic lavas associated with pyroclastics and small volumes of alkali basalt, trachybasalt and trachyandesite lavas. Two groups of volcanic rocks can be distinguished: (1) calcalkaline rocks including andesites and dacites, and (2) alkaline rocks including basalts, trachybasalts and trachyandesites. Ar/Ar ages show that the Karacada\u011f volcanites were erupted during Early Miocene (ca.18\u201319 Ma) and suggest that alkaline volcanites succeed shortly afterwards calcalkaline volcanites. Major oxides and trace elements plotted versus SiO suggest fractionation of hornblende, Fe\u2013Ti oxide and apatite for calcalkaline volcanic rocks and olivine, clinopyroxene and Fe\u2013Ti oxide for alkaline volcanic rocks in the magmatic evolution. The incompatible trace element patterns of the calcalkaline volcanites show enrichment of LILEs (Sr, K, Rb, Ba and Th) and negative HFSEs (Nb, Ta) anomalies suggesting an enriched lithospheric source by a subduction-related process. On the other hand, alkaline volcanites show enrichment of both LILEs and HFSEs suggesting an enriched lithospheric source by small volume melts from the asthenosphere. The rocks also have moderately fractionated REE patterns with (La/Lu) ratios of 7\u201324 for calcalkaline and 6\u201317 for alkaline volcanites. Moreover, the volcanites have relatively low Sr/Sr(t) ratios for between 0.703782 and 0.705129, and high () values between +2.25 and +4.49. Generally, the Sr\u2013Nd isotopic compositions of the rocks range from the mantle array to bulk earth. All of these observations and findings suggest that the calcalkaline volcanites were formed in a subduction modified orogenic setting, and the alkaline volcanites in a within-plate setting.",

        "abstract": "The Shi-Hang zone is an important NE trending Mesozoic magmatic belt composed of granites with relative high \u03b5(t) values and young T model ages in South China. However, the petrogenesis and the tectonic environment for the Shi-Hang zone magmatic rocks remain controversial. We report here mineral chemistry, geochemical and Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Hf isotopic data for the Cailing and Furong granites and mafic microgranular enclaves (MMEs) from the Qitianling granite batholith in southern Hunan province, South China. The Qitianling granite batholith is a multi-staged composite pluton with three phases (Cailing, Furong, and Huangtangling) according to their ages and petrography. The Cailing (163\u2013160 Ma) and Furong (157\u2013153 Ma) phases are mainly composed of porphyritic amphibole\u2013biotite monzogranite, and they share similar geochemical and isotopic characteristics. Both of them show similar SiO contents from 66.50 to 70.28%, and metaluminous A/CNK values of 0.80 to 0.98. The granites are characterized by high contents of large ion lithosphile elements (LILE) such as Rb, Th, U, Pb; high field strength elements (HFSE) such as Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf; and Zr + Nb + Ce + Y contents > 350 ppm, and high 10,000 \u2217 Ga/Al ratios > 2.6. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns show relative enrichment of light rare earth elements (LREEs) and significant negative Eu anomalies. Mineralogical and geochemical features suggest that the Cailing and Furong granites are A-type, which can be further classified as A subtype. They have relatively lower (Sr/Sr) ratios (0.7091\u20130.7132), higher \u03b5(t) values (\u2212 5.5 to \u2212 7.6) and younger Nd isotopic model ages (1.48\u20131.56 Ga) than those common S-type granites in South China. Zircon \u03b5(t) values vary from \u2212 8.1 to \u2212 3.7. The MMEs in the Cailing phase show similar trace element and Sr\u2013Nd isotopic characteristics with the host granites. But zircons from the MMEs show different \u03b5(t) values (\u2212 6.4\u2013+ 2.6) with those from the host granites (\u2212 8.1 to \u2212 3.7). This indicates that the MMEs and host granites were crystallized from different sources of magmas, providing direct evidence for mafic\u2013felsic magma mixing processes. The isotope data indicate that the Cailing and Furong granites from the Qitianling batholith were derived from a hybrid magma consisting of about 80% felsic magma derived from old crust and about 20% mantle-derived mafic magma. The strong magma mixing at about 160\u2013155 Ma caused by intra-arc rifting or back arc extension related to subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate, is favored to explain the petrogenesis of the Cailing and Furong granites, as well as the Shi-Hang zone.\u25ba The Cailing and Furong granites from the Qitianling batholith in south China belong to A-type granite. \u25ba Geochemical and isotopic studies indicate a mafic-felsic magma mixing process. \u25ba An intra-arc rifting or back arc extension setting is proposed for the extensive magmatism.",

The investigated mantle xenoliths are spinel lherzolites in composition with a protogranular texture. They can be classified into two types: anhydrous and hydrous spinel lherzolites; the latter group characterized by the occurrences of pargasite and phlogopite. The compositions of whole-rock basaltic component (CaO = 3.8\u20135.6 wt%, Al2O3 = 2.5\u20134.1 wt%, and MgO = 34.7\u201338.1 wt%), spinel (Cr# = 0.062\u20130.117, Al2O3 = 59.0\u201364.4 wt%) and clinopyroxene (Mg# = 88.4\u201391.7, Al2O3 = 5.2\u20136.7 wt%) indicate that the lherzolites are fertile and have not experienced significant partial melting. Both types are characterized by depleted 87Sr/86Sr (0.70180\u20130.70295) and high 143Nd/144Nd (0.51299\u20130.51348) with wide ranges of 206Pb/204Pb (17.86\u201319.68) isotopic compositions. The variations of geochemical and isotopic compositions can be explained by silicate metasomatism induced by different degree of magma infiltrations from ascending mantle plume. The thermobarometric estimations suggest that the spinel lherzolites were derived from depths of 50\u201370 km (15.6\u201322.2 kb) and entrained in the alkaline magma at 847\u20131,052\u00b0C. Most of the spinel lherzolites from this study record an elevated geotherm (60\u201390 mW/m2) that is related to the presence of rising mantle plume in an active tectonic setting. Sm\u2013Nd isotopic systematic gives a mean TDM model age of 0.95 Ga, interpreted as the minimum depletion age of the subcontinental lithosphere beneath the region.",

        "abstract": "Continental subduction is an important but poorly known means of transporting the Earth's crust into the mantle. Continental subduction has also been proposed to responsible for the formation of the Cenozoic intracontinental potassic rocks widespread in Tibet and uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. However, such ancient continental subduction only occasionally been identified and is controversial. In this contribution, we explore the use of boron and its isotopes, to provide new constraints on the origin of newly identified Eocene potassium-rich volcanic rocks in northern Tibet and potential subduction of continental crust. Our results indicate that the latest Eocene (ca. 34 Ma) potassium-rich volcanic rocks are characterised by moderate silica, adakite-like trace elements, enriched Sr-Nd-Pb and light boron isotope (\u03b4B = \u221220.12\u2030 to \u22127.95\u2030) signatures. This isotopically light signature of boron suggests a m\u00e9lange source composed of mantle wedge peridotite and recycled dehydrated continental crust. The Eocene potassium-rich magmas were likely derived from low-degree partial melting of diapir m\u00e9lange at high-pressure and medium temperature within subduction channel. Our work indicates potential obduction of the Tibetan plate over the Asian plate thus triggering intracontinental subduction before the end of Eocene. This continental obduction may have accommodated a huge amount of crustal material during Cenozoic rapid convergence between India and Asia. We conclude that during this process an isotopically light component is likely to have been transported into the mantle to form a distinct source region. B isotopes therefore have the potential to trace the continental crust recycling in large collisional orogens.",

        "abstract": "Picrites from the Lijiang area, in the western part of the Emeishan flood basalt province, are considered to be one of the most important indicators of the Emeishan mantle plume, and may represent initial mantle plume activity. This paper presents the first Re\u2013Os isotope data for picrites from the province. Eighteen geochemically well characterised samples, including 12 picrites and 6 basalts from two sections near Lijiang, have been analyzed for Os isotopes. The picrites from the two sections have overlapping Re and Os concentrations and initial Os isotopic compositions. They have higher Os concentrations (1.5\u20133 parts per billion), and slightly lower Re concentrations (< 0.07 ppb) than those from many other flood basalt provinces (FBPs) and ocean island picrites. The picrites have distinctly unradiogenic Os isotopes with () values ( = 259 Ma) of \u2212 0.9 to \u2212 2.4, but the associated basalts have suprachondritic Os isotope compositions with () of 1.8 to 73.3, which overlap with published data for basalts from other localities in the province. The high () values of the basalts could be the result of crustal contamination, which is enabled by the low Os concentrations in the parental basalts. The low () values of the picrites are unusual in terms of plume-related magmatism. There is no clear evidence for recycled crustal material in the mantle source of the Emeishan picrites, or for a significant degree of interaction of the picrites with ancient subcontinental lithospheric mantle of the Yangtze craton. The low () values relative to many other plume-related picrites (from ocean islands or flood basalt provinces) indicate that there was no clear Os isotope evidence of involvement of the Earth's core or recycled crustal components in the formation of Emeishan flood basalt province.",

        "abstract": "Major and trace element, Nd and for the first time Hf isotopic compositions of Central European Hercynian and Alpine alkaline (nephelinites) and calc-alkaline (minettes) lamprophyres are reported. The alkaline dikes have significantly higher initial values ( +3.9 to +5.2) than the calc-alkaline dikes ( \u22121 to \u22127). Their initial values range between +1.9 and +6.0. Both groups show the typical high level of incompatible-element enrichment. In addition the calc-alkaline lamprophyres are characterized by an overabundance of Cs relative to Rb, high and ratios as well as depletion in Nb, Ti and Ta. Covariations between initial and trace elements suggest that crust-mantle mixing processes were involved in the formation of the calc-alkaline mafic magmas.These data give way to a general, refined model of lamprophyre genesis and provide information about enrichment processes in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle.It is suggested that alkaline and calc-alkaline lamprophyres originate from similar mantle segments. Alkaline lamprophyres can be generated by 10% partial melting of a metasomatically enriched garnet peridotite. Calc-alkaline lamprophyres, however, can be generated in subduction related environments by mixing of 5\u201315% sedimentary melts, strongly enriched in K, Rb, Zr, Hf, Y and REE, produced by partial melting of subducted oceanic sediments, with a metasomatically enriched mantle source similar to that suggested for the ultramafic alkaline dikes.",

The complex comprises a two-phase rapakivi granite batholith with subordinate quartz\u2013fayalite monzonites and syenites and the closely associated Repartimento anorthosite. Zircon U\u2013Pb (ID\u2013TIMS) geochronology reveals that the anorthosite (1526 \u00b1 2 Ma), monzonite (1526 \u00b1 2 Ma), and the main-phase biotite\u2013hornblende granite (1527 \u00b1 2 Ma) of the complex intruded the Paleoproterozoic (~ 1.94 Ga) country rocks simultaneously at ~ 1526 Ma and that the more evolved biotite granite is marginally younger at 1519 \u00b1 2 Ma. Intraplate magmatism in the Mucaja\u00ed region was relatively short-lived and lasted 12 million years (1529\u20131517 Ma) at maximum. The Nd (whole-rock, ID\u2013TIMS; \u03b5 from \u2212 1.9 to \u2212 2.8), Hf (zircon, LAM-ICP-MS; \u03b5 from \u2212 2.0 to \u2212 3.1), and O (zircon, SIMS; \u03b4O from 6.1 to 7.0\u2030) isotopic compositions of the studied rocks are fairly uniform but still reveal a small degree of isotopic heterogeneity in the Paleoproterozoic crust enclosing the complex. The small isotopic differences observed in the two types of rapakivi granites (biotite\u2013hornblende granite and biotite granite) may result either from an isotopically heterogeneous lower crustal source or, more likely, from contamination of the granitic magma derived from a lower crustal source during prolonged residence at upper crustal levels.\u25ba Petrogenesis of the 1525 Ma Mucaja\u00ed complex in Brazil was studied. \u25ba U\u2013Pb, Sm\u2013Nd, Lu\u2013Hf, and O isotopic and geochemical methods were utilized. \u25ba Rapakivi granite and anorthositic magmatism lasted at most 12 million years. \u25ba Late magmatic shift in isotope compositions of coeval granites was observed.",

        "abstract": "The Tojottamanselk\u00e4 gneisses of the Koitelainen region, northern Finland, have been dated by the Sm-Nd and the common Pb methods. The Sm-Nd data of seven samples from a small area (100 m \u00d7 100 m) define an isochron ofT=3.06\u00b10.12 (2\u03c3) Ga, with correspondingINd=0.50848\u00b19 (2\u03c3), or\u03b5Nd(T)=\u22123.7\u00b11.8. This age is in good agreement with the zircon U-Pb discordia age (3.1 Ga) reported by Kr\u00f6ner et al. (1981) and is interpreted as the time of magmatic emplacement. The distinctly negative\u03b5Nd(T) value is found for the first time for Archean tonalitic gneisses and implies derivation of these magmas by remelting of continental material with a long (200\u2013500 Ma) crustal residence time. A few samples, on the other hand, possess\u03b5Nd(T) values close to zero, hence they are thought to be derived by partial melting of basaltic sources with nearchondritic REE distribution patterns.Common Pb isotopic data yield an isochron age of 2.64\u00b10.24 (2\u03c3) Ga which is in agreement, within error limit, with the published Rb-Sr isochron age of 2.73\u00b10.24 Ga (Kr\u00f6ner et al. 1981). The age of ca. 2.7 Ga is interpreted as the time of regional metamorphism during which both Pb and Sr isotopes were rehomogenised.The tonalitic gneisses have highly fractionated REE patterns with (La/Yb)N ratios varying from 9 to 43. Like most Archean gneisses of TTG composition (tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite), they could be derived by partial melting of crustal sources of basaltic to granodioritic compositions. Direct derivation by melting of mantle peridotites is excluded.The present geochemical study indicates that the Tojottamanselk\u00e4 gneisses have had a very complex history that involved multi-stage development. Together with the published age data for the basement gneisses and greenstone belts of eastern central Finland (Vidal et al. 1980; Martin et al. 1983a), we conclude that the Archean crustal development in Finland started at least 3.5 Ga ago and passed through a series of magmatic and metamorphic events at 3.1, 2.85, 2.65 and 2.5 Ga before the final intrusions of K-rich granites about 2.4 Ga ago.",

        "abstract": "The Cape Verde volcanic archipelago, located in the oceanic portion of the African plate some 500 km west of the Senegal coast, is renowned for the occurrence of carbonatites on at least 5 of its 10 islands. In this study we report the occurrence of about twenty new small outcrops of extrusive carbonatites on Brava Island (64 km), the south-westernmost island of the archipelago. These new occurrences are studied from geological, petrographic, mineral chemistry and whole rock (elemental and isotopic) geochemical points of view, allowing for a discussion of their petrogenesis and emphasising their geological and geochemical peculiarities in the context of the Cape Verde carbonatites.Most of the extrusive carbonatitic formations correspond to pyroclastic rocks, comprising magmatic and/or phreatomagmatic ash and lapilli fall deposits and one probable pyroclastic flow. Lava flows occur at one locality. The predominance of pyroclastic facies demonstrates the significant explosivity of these magmas characterised by very low viscosity. Independent of the modes of emplacement, all samples are calciocarbonatites and exhibit a remarkable compositional uniformity, considering that they represent several different eruptions and present a wide geographical dispersion.Brava extrusive carbonatites belong to the younger (probable Holocene \u2013 Pleistocene) volcanic sequence of the island. This feature is unique in the context of Cape Verde geology, because in the other islands (including Brava) of the archipelago carbonatites are commonly assigned to the basal complexes, having formed during a fairly early stage of the emerged evolution of volcanic construction.Compared with the older intrusive s\u00f6vitic rocks occurring at Middle Unit of Brava Island, extrusive facies are more iron and manganese rich and yield higher contents of trace elements like Ba, Th, U, Nb, Pb and REE, but somewhat lower Sr abundances. New initial Sr and Nd isotope data (0.703557\u20130.703595 and 0.512792\u20130.512816, respectively) determined in extrusive calciocarbonatitic rocks are clearly different from those obtained in intrusive rocks (0.703340\u20130.703356 and 0.512910\u20130.512912, respectively), which demonstrates that the studied rocks were ultimately the product of a source distinct from those that produced the older intrusive carbonatites. Brava extrusive carbonatites yield isotope signatures that are clearly distinct from all other Cape Verde carbonatites, but akin to the Southern Cape Verde silicate rocks. We propose that the extrusive carbonatites resulted from an immiscibility process that also produced conjugate melts of nephelinitic composition.",

        "abstract": "The Astroni volcano was built through seven eruptions that generated pyroclastic deposits and lava domes within the Campi Flegrei caldera (southern Italy) 4.1\u20133.8 ka BP. Whole-rock geochemical and B\u2013Sr\u2013Nd isotopic investigations were carried out on representative samples of all seven eruptions. The products vary from tephriphonolites to phonolites, and from latites to trachytes. They show textural, mineralogical and isotopic evidence of disequilibrium, including distinct clinopyroxene populations, rounded and/or resorbed plagioclase and alkali-feldspar, and reverse-zoned phenocrysts of all these mineral phases. The Sr, Nd and B isotopic composition of whole rocks is variable and correlated with the degree of chemical evolution, suggesting open-system processes in addition to fractional crystallisation. Moreover, significant Sr-isotopic disequilibrium between the phenocrysts and glass has been documented for one sample.The chemostratigraphy of the products indicates that Astroni eruptions 1 through 5 were fed by magmas of trachytic to phonolitic composition that were less enriched in radiogenic Sr and B up-section. This variability has been interpreted as the result of mingling between at least two distinct magmatic end-members, one more evolved and the other less evolved. Another heterogeneous batch of magma, resulting from almost complete mixing between the same two end-members, was drained during eruptions 6 and 7. The more evolved end-member, characterised by Sr/Sr \u2265 0.7075, Nd/Nd \u2264 0.51247 and B \u2265 \u2212 8\u2030, was very similar to the magma that fed the final phases of the Agnano\u2013Monte Spina eruption, which occurred a few centuries earlier in the Astroni vent area. The less evolved end-member had Sr/Sr \u2264 0.70726, Nd/Nd \u2265 0.51251 and B \u2264 10\u2030, and was likely derived by fractional crystallisation of a mantle-derived magma. An abrupt decrease in both the Sr isotope ratio and the Th content, detected at the transition between Unit 4 and 5, suggests that another magma with a Sr/Sr ratio intermediate between those of the two identified end-members may have been involved in Astroni activity. The more evolved end-member is interpreted as a residue of the Agnano\u2013Monte Spina eruption that was invaded by either the intermediate or the less evolved magmatic end-member, promoting mingling and triggering Astroni activity.This study of Astroni provides insights for both short- and long-term volcanic hazard assessment, as the Astroni volcano is the best example of a very close sequence of eruptions from the same vent area in the Campi Flegrei caldera.",

Geochemical analyses (major and trace elements; Sr, Nd and O isotopic compositions) of syn-rift rhyolites ranging in age from 28 to 2.5 Ma indicate that the rhyolites can be derived from mantle-sourced basaltic magma through fractional crystallization accompanied by variable amounts of crustal contamination (e.g.",

        "abstract": "The Cl\u00e9ricy Pluton in the southern Abitibi greenstone belt of Qu\u00e9bec is a syenitic intrusion cross-cut by nordmarkitic dykes. It is probably one of the oldest known ultrapotassic intrusions (about 2.7 Ga). It crystallized in a crustal environment under low < 2.5 kbar) and low conditions. Most trace elements behaved as compatible elements suggesting that sphene and apatite were involved together with clinopyroxene during low-pressure crystal fractionation. The large range of initial isotopic ratios (calculated for 2.68 Ga, \u03f5 \u22121.9 + 2.3), as well as the trace element distribution, suggest that the syenitic pluton is the product of differentiation from a parental magma with a composition similar to that of Timiskaming-type Archaean shoshonites contaminated by a crustal component. On the other hand, the nordmarkitic dykes are probably the result of crustal anatexis of metasedimentary rocks and some addition of the syenitic magma. The Cl\u00e9ricy peralkaline syenite differs chemically from typical intraplate syenites in being saturated with respect to quartz, and displaying lower Ti and HFSE contents. It is related to an ultrapotassic volcano-plutonic event, which characterized the last 20 Ma of igneous activity in the Abitibi greenstone belt. It may represent an increased rate of convergence of small heterogeneous plates during a subduction-driven accretion tectonic event which possibly marked the culmination of the Kenoran Orogeny in the Superior Province of the Canadian Shield.",

        "abstract": "Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary volcanic and plutonic rocks in western Alaska comprise a vast magmatic province extending from the Alaska Range north to the Arctic Circle, south to Bristol Bay, and west to the Bering Sea Shelf. The chemical and isotopic composition of five of these Late Cretaceous to early Tertiary volcanic fields in the north central part of this province were studied to determine if Paleozoic or older continental crust underlies the Yukon\u2010Koyukuk province. Three of the fields, the Blackburn Hills, Yukon River, and Kanuti, occur within the Yukon\u2010Koyukuk province and two, the Sischu and Nowitna, overlie bordering Precambrian and Paleozoic metamorphic terranes to the southeast. High initial 87Sr/86Sr of 0.7075\u20130.7079 and moderate initial 143Nd/144Nd of 0.51244\u20130.51247 of rhyolite, dacite, and high\u2010silica andesite of the Sischu volcanic field indicate that the magmas have interacted with the underlying Paleozoic or older continental crust. The relatively limited variation of isotopic (initial 87Sr/86Sr = 0.7044\u20130.7051; initial 143Nd/144Nd = 0.51256\u20130.51257) and elemental compositions of andesites from the Nowitna field can be accounted for by assimilation of small amounts of Paleozoic or older continental crust during crystal fractionation of andesite parent magmas at crustal levels. The Blackburn Hills field, which consists of medium\u2010K basalt, andesite, and rhyolite intruded by a small granitic pluton, has a large range in initial 87Sr/86Sr and initial 143Nd/144Nd that plot in the field for 60 Ma mantle, from near mid\u2010ocean ridge basalts to near \u201cbulk\u2010earth\u201d compositions (initial 87Sr/86Sr = 0.7033\u20130.7052; initial 143Nd/144Nd = 0.51253\u20130.51290). Andesites and basalts from the Blackburn Hills are divided into two group on the basis of rare earth element (REE) and isotopic composition. Isotopic variation in the more primitive group 1 is best explained by assimilation of the lower crust of the Jurassic to Early Cretaceous Koyukuk terrane by mantle\u2010derived basalts during crystal fractionation, though part of the isotopic variation may be due to metasomatism of an oceanic island basalt type mantle source by fluids derived from subducted sediments. Group 2 andesites from the Blackburn Hills have lower heavy REE abundances and more enriched isotopic compositions. These group 2 andesites and dacites from the Kanuti field, which have (87Sr/86Sr)i = 0.7043\u20130.7048 and (143Nd/144Nd)i = 0.51248\u20130.51267, appear to have formed by partial melting of the lower crust of the Koyukuk terrane. The Yukon River field consists of basalt, andesite, dacite, and rhyolite having (87Sr/86Sr)i = 0.7037\u20130.7051 and (143Nd/144Nd)i = 0.51266\u20130.51280; its isotopic composition does not require the presence of Paleozoic or older continental crust under the volcanic field and may have formed by interaction between mantle\u2010derived melts and the oceanic Angayucham/Tozitna or island arc Koyukuk terrane. Most of the intrusive rocks and rhyolite domes from the Blackburn Hills volcanic field have (87Sr/86Sr)i = 0.7038\u20130.7041 and dacites from the Kanuti volcanic field have (87Sr/86Sr)i = 0.7043\u20130.7048. Thus little or no old continental crust was involved in the genesis of the Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary rocks and therefore probably does not extend beneath this part of the Yukon\u2010Koyukuk province. However, the ultimate source of the small volumes of enriched shoshonitic andesite (87Sr/86Sr = 0.7075, 143Nd/144Nd = 0.5125) erupted at 118 Ma in the Yukon\u2010Koyukuk province may be continental lithosphere, which may have been thrust under this part of the Yukon\u2010Koyukuk province during arc\u2010continent collision in the Early Cretaceous.",

        "abstract": "The distribution of volcanism in the Late Devonian Pripyat-Dnieper-Donets rift within the East European Platform, based upon the results of deep drilling, indicates that pre-existing basement structures and the major rift-bounding faults played an important role in channelling the magmas towards the surface. Major- and trace-element and SrNd isotopic studies of the most primitive basic and ultrabasic magmas, combined with estimates of the amount of extension (\u03b2 = 1.1 to 1.3), strongly suggest that magmatism was triggered by the upwelling of a thermally and geochemically anomalous mantle plume from the deep mantle during the Late Frasnian. The peak of the magmatism occurred in the Famennian, coincident with the maximum amount of lithospheric extension. Magmatism, rifting and domal basement uplife were contemporaneous at several localities within the EEP, suggesting that the thermal and geodynamic evolution of the platform could have been influenced by a cluster of mantle plumes during the Late Devonian.",

        "abstract": "The Meso-Cenozoic geodynamic evolution of the Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt, which is one of the key areas of the Alpine-Himalayan system, is still controversial due to lack of systematic geological, geophysical, geochemical and chronological data. The prevailing interpretation is that this belt represents the southern margin of Eurasia during the Mesozoic and its geodynamic evolution is related to northward subduction of oceanic lithosphere. This paper reports the first detailed geological, geochemical and chronological data from felsic tuffs interbedded with late Cretaceous turbidites in the Southern Zone of the Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt.Individual tuff layers are thin, mostly < 2 m in thickness, implying that these are dominantly air-fall tuffs. Petrographic data indicate that the felsic tuffs, which exhibit various degrees of alteration, can be classified as crystal-rich and crystal-poor tuffs. The crystal-poor tuffs consist mainly of 45\u201365% devitrified glass shards and 10\u201320% broken quartz crystals, whereas the crystal-rich tuffs consist of > 50% crystals. The zircon U\u2013Pb data show three statistically distinct ages at 84, 81 and 77 Ma, with uncertainties of about 1 Ma, suggesting that tuff-forming late Cretaceous magmatism started about 84 Ma ago and was episodically active over a minimum of 7 Ma. The age data also indicate that the average accumulation rate of the turbiditic sequence that hosts the felsic tuffs remained constant between 36 and 40 cm/10 ky. Their enrichment in LIL and LRE elements relative to HFS and HRE elements, and also strongly negative Nb, Ta and Ti anomalies, are consistent with those of magmas generated by subduction-related processes. The tuffs have relatively low initial ratios of Nd/Nd (0.512296\u20130.512484; \u03b5: \u2212 2.1 and \u2212 7.2) and Sr/Sr (0.704896\u20130.706159). Their initial Pb isotopic compositions range from 18.604 to 18.646 for Pb/Pb, from 15.644 to 15.654 for Pb/Pb and from 38.712 to 38.763 for Pb/Pb. The distribution of Sr\u2013Nd isotopic compositions in the late Cretaceous igneous rocks from different locations of the Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt is consistent with two-component mixing between depleted mantle and crust. However, the Pb isotopic data are not compatible with two-component mixing and require at least a third component.Considering all of the new data and also previous data such as southward migration and increasing potassium content of the late Cretaceous arc volcanism, the northward migration of Cenozoic igneous activity, northward drift of the belt since the late Cretaceous and the existence of south-dipping reverse fault systems in the whole region, the Meso-Cenozoic geodynamic evolution of the Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt can be best explained by southward subduction of Tethys oceanic lithosphere, rather than northward subduction.",

        "abstract": "Cenozoic intra-plate volcanism in Southwest China allows insights into modes of melting and the composition of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). The late Cenozoic Tengchong Volcanic Field (TVF), located in the Yunnan Province Northeast of the Himalayas, comprises a cluster of mafic continental intraplate lavas, represented by 68 volcanic cones and spanning an area of ca. 800\u202fkm. Major and trace element data and Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotope ratios of 18 newly sampled rocks from the area are used to identify the composition of their source in the SCLM. Indices of magmatic differentiation are correlated with isotope composition, marking a classic case of assimilation-fractional-crystallization (AFC) during petrogenesis. The most primitive samples, identified on the basis of element and isotope compositions, are interpreted to be directly derived from the metasomatised mantle underneath south-western China. Modelling of a best-fit scenario indicates that the isotope and trace element character of these samples can be reproduced by ca. 1% partial melting of a metasomatised mantle source, composed of depleted MORB mantle infused with 1% addition of a bulk global subducting sediment (GLOSS) component. Average isotope compositions of Sr/Sr\u202f=\u202f0.705861, Nd/Nd\u202f=\u202f0.512675, Hf/Hf\u202f=\u202f0.282962, Pb/Pb\u202f=\u202f18.305, Pb/Pb\u202f=\u202f15.642 and Pb/Pb\u202f=\u202f38.948 are proposed for the present-day enriched part of the SCLM. The origin of the isotopic signatures is ascribed to modifications of parent-daughter ratios in the SCLM by past subduction-related metasomatism, possibly in the form of sediment m\u00e9lange diapirs. This implied that the mantle source of TVF lavas is not, as previously proposed, related to enriched geochemical reservoirs (EM-1, EM-2) associated with mantle plume activity or to so-called Dupal or Indian asthenospheric mantle. Instead, it is argued that time-integrated parent-daughter fractionation occurred long before India-Asia collision and this produced reservoirs with isotopic compositions that resemble some but not all aspects of the Dupal isotope signature. In analogy, so-called Dupal isotope signatures elsewhere may also be the result of contamination of the mantle by a crustal component, most likely subducted sediment.",

        "abstract": "Tertiary volcanic rocks were erupted across the Mojave Desert and southeastern California in the early to middle Miocene after a long period of magmatic quiescence. Eruption of these rocks generally coincided with regional extension. New Sr, Nd, and whole-rock Pb isotopic data for Miocene rocks, from a transect from the western Mojave Desert to the Colorado River trough, provide clues to crustal and mantle structure during this important time period. Volcanism was calc-alkalic but transitional to alkalic in the eastern part of the area. Trace element contents, trace element ratios, and radiogenic isotopic compositions vary across the study area, and isotopic composition is correlated with both bulk chemical composition and longitude. Correlation of isotopic composition with bulk composition results from widespread contamination of mantle-derived basalts with crust. Variation of isotopic composition versus longitude for rocks of all bulk compositions reflects longitudinal variations in both mantle and crustal structure. Geochemical signatures of mafic rocks east of about long 116\u00b0W indicate an ancient (Precambrian) enriched lithosphere source. Some thinned and/or reworked Precambrian crust extends west of 116\u00b0W. Mafic rocks west of 116\u00b0W were derived from mantle with oceanic geochemical and isotopic signatures. There is no clear, coincident, major crustal structure or tectonic boundary in surface geology at 116\u00b0W; however, modern-day seismicity is restricted to areas west of this longitude, and there is a change in the dominant orientation of mountain ranges at this longitude. The data here also indicate that the long-standing problem of drawing the Sri = 0.706 line through the Mojave Desert can be resolved if the line represents the west edge of the North American mantle rather than Precambrian crust. By this definition, the Sri = 0.706 line would be the isotopic boundary at 116\u00b0W. The cause of early Miocene volcanism in the Mojave Desert remains enigmatic. An oceanic mantle source for early Miocene basalts in the western Mojave Desert suggests a possible connection to asthenospheric mantle volcanism in the California Coast Ranges. Simple models of decompression melting of enriched mantle following convective thinning and extension of the lithosphere cannot be applied across the Mojave Desert.",

        "abstract": "Like many continental flood basalt (CFB) provinces in the world, the source mantle compositions and melting conditions for generation of the Emeishan CFB are highly debated. We have carried out an integrated Sr-Nd-O-Mg isotopic study of the Emeishan picritic lavas to evaluate possible effects of mantle heterogeneity on the magma composition. Moreover, we have used PRIMELT3 () to calculate the primary magma compositions and melting conditions for these picritic lavas. Picrites from Maoniuping, Tanglanghe and Wuguijing exhibit depleted Sr-Nd isotopic compositions (Sr/Sr = 0.7038\u20130.7050; \u03b5 = 0.27\u20133.89), normal mantle-like \u03b4Mg (\u22120.27 to \u22120.2\u2030) and \u03b4O (5.0\u20135.4\u2030), which can be explained by partial melting of plume materials with negligible contribution of sedimentary carbonates. The Wulongba picrites are characterized by depleted Sr-Nd isotopic compositions (Sr/Sr = 0.7041\u20130.7045; \u03b5 = 2.57\u20132.85), slightly lower \u03b4Mg (\u22120.36 to \u22120.23\u2030) and higher \u03b4O (5.6\u20135.7\u2030), which were attributed to involvement of minor sedimentary carbonates (magnesite) in their mantle source. The calculated mantle potential temperatures for the Emeishan picrites range from 1516 to 1596 \u00b0C. The initial melting pressures range from 4 to 5 GPa. The final melting pressures for the Wulongba picrites (2\u20133 GPa) are lower than those for the Tanglanghe, Maoniuping and Wuguijing picrites (>3 GPa). This suggests that the Wulongba picrites were generated in shallower garnet-spinel transition zone of the upper mantle. Picrites from other three localities are entirely generated in garnet stability field of the upper mantle.",

        "abstract": "Alkaline magmatism during the late Proterozoic is an important event in the northern part of the South Indian granulite terrain. A number of alkaline plutons comprising saturated syenite and ultramafic rocks often associated with carbonatite are found localized along NEHYPHEN;SW trending lineaments, which are considered as deep crustal fractures. Along one such lineament, the alkaline complexes of Yelagiri, Sevattur and Samalpatti have intruded into the country rocks comprising epidote hornblende gneiss. The isotope characteristics and geochemistry of Yelagiri and Sevattur plutons are examined in this paper. Whole rock Rbhyphen;Sr isochron ages of the Yelagiri and Sevattur syenites are 757\u00b132 Ma and 756\u00b111 Ma respectively. The close spatial relationship, similarities in age, mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of these plutons strongly suggest their close genetic relationship. The initial Sr and Nd isotope ratios of the Sevattur carbonatites suggest their derivation from an alkali metal and LREE enriched mantle source. However, the silicate rocks of the Yelagiri and Sevattur plutons have distinctly different isotopic characteristics from this enriched mantle source. Combined geochemical and isotopic characteristics of these silicate rocks indicate that silicate rocks of both plutons are derived independently from isotopically different sources from those of carbonatites. Moreover, comparison with the isotopic characteristics of Archean crustal rocks in South India indicates that the source regions of both silicate rocks are lowerhyphen;crustal portions, which are deeper than any other crustal portion exposed in South India, or isotopically metasomatized crustal portions by volatile influx from carbonatite.",

        "abstract": "Qulong porphyry Cu deposit is the largest Cu deposit in China so far discovered, with total reserves of 10.6 Mt % and 0.5 Mt %. The petrogenesis of the Miocene intrusion and its genetic association with Cu mineralization have been debated. This study presents new results on whole rock major and trace elements, Sr\u2013Nd isotopes, zircon U\u2013Pb dating, Hf\u2013O isotopic compositions of the Qulong ore-bearing and barren adakites. All the Qulong adakites studied here have low MgO (< 2 wt.%), high KO (between 2 wt.% and 6 wt.%), with KO/NaO ratios ranging from 0.2\u20132.0. The SiO contents are mostly higher than 64 wt.%. These are dramatically different from ore-forming adakites in the circum-Pacific region and other places in general. Ore-bearing adakites have systematically higher SiO and KO compared with barren ones, likely due to the addition of Si and K during alteration and mineralization. Magmatic zircons from these two series of intrusions have U\u2013Pb ages of 16.6 \u00b1 0.5\u201317.0 \u00b1 0.6 Ma and 16.7 \u00b1 0.3\u201317.4 \u00b1 0.4 Ma, respectively, which are identical to each other within analytical errors but are systematically older than although marginally overlap with the Re\u2013Os isochron ages of 15.36 \u00b1 0.21\u201316.41 \u00b1 0.48 Ma. The Qulong porphyries have geochemical characteristics of typical adakites, with Sr = 259\u20131195 ppm, Y = 1.91\u20139.12 ppm, Yb = 0.2\u20130.92 ppm, Sr/Y = 49\u2013202 ppm, and (La/Yb) = 13\u201349 for both ore-bearing and barren adakites. In a Sr/Y versus (La/Yb) diagram, most of the samples plot in the low part of circum-Pacific field, close to the field defined by Dabie adakites. Some of the ore-bearing adakites even plot in the Dabie adakite field, indicating that both slab melts and lower continental crust melts have been involved. Zircons from the ore-bearing adakites have \u03b4O ranging from 5.1 to 7.3\u2030 (average 6.4\u2030) and \u03b5Hf(t) from 1.9 to 10.4\u2030, which plot close to MORB. Similarly, zircons from the barren adakite have \u03b4O ranging from 4.0 to 7.4\u2030 (average 6.3\u2030) and \u03b5Hf(t) from 5.6 to 9.3\u2030, mostly plotting close to MORB values, too. In-situ zircon Hf\u2013O isotopic measurements for the most samples yield a binary mixing trend between mantle- and crustal-derived melts, with mantle-related sources as the main contributor. Whole-rock Sr\u2013Nd isotopes also show small variations, with (Sr/Sr) = 0.704904\u20130.705053 and \u03b5Nd(t) = \u2212 0.04\u20130.61. The dramatic differences between Qulong and circum-Pacific adakites suggest that either Qulong porphyry Cu deposit is unique, or the ore-bearing adakites are not the ore-forming porphyry. Considering the identical geochemical characteristics of the ore-bearing and barren adakites, the textures (some samples are not porphyry) and the systematically older ages compared to Re\u2013Os isochron ages, the latter is preferred. In contrast to earlier adakitic granites, recently studied porphyries in the central phase of the Qulong deposit have zircon U\u2013Pb ages identical to the Re\u2013Os ages, and thus are more likely to be the ore-forming porphyry. All these suggest that slab melting rather than partial melting of Gangdese arc materials is responsible to the Qulong porphyry Cu deposit.",

        "abstract": "U-series activity ratios, Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic ratios and major and trace element compositions have been determined on young basalts (<10\u2009ka) and trachytes from the volcano Emuruangogolak in the Kenya Rift Valley. The basalts are mildly alkaline and are associated with small volumes of hawaiite. The mafic rocks are characterised by high (230Th/232Th) (\u22651.06) with low (238U/230Th) ratios (\u22640.72). They have variable incompatible trace element ratios (e.g. Zr/Nb, Ba/Zr), indicating that they represent a number of magmatic lineages. The trachytes, which comprise both comenditic and pantelleritic varieties, have significantly lower (230Th/232Th) ratios than the basalts, with clear differences between pantelleritic and comenditic types. The (238U/230Th) ratios in the pantellerites range from less, to greater, than 1. The variations in composition and isotopic diversity must represent different sources for the trachytes. Internal isochrons for the trachytes give U-Th ages of 14 to 40\u2009ka, similar to single crystal laser fusion 40Ar/39Ar ages from sanidine phenocrysts (16\u201338\u2009ka) for the same rocks. Post-crystallisation residence times of the trachytes were very short, implying relatively rapid movement of trachyte from magma chamber to the surface. Variations in the initial (230Th/232Th)0 ratios (0.69\u20131.14) of both basalts and trachytes indicate that Emuruangogolak has erupted a large range of isotopically diverse magmas over a very short period of time (38\u2009ka), from conduits closely spaced around the summit of the volcano.",

        "abstract": "The Hongge layered intrusion (259 Ma), which is located in the inner zone of the Emeishan large igneous province (ELIP), is one of the most typical Fe\u2013Ti\u2013V ore deposits in the Pan\u2013Xi area. Mafic\u2013ultramafic layered intrusions of the ELIP have attracted a lot of attention lately because these intrusions host world class Fe\u2013Ti\u2013V oxide deposits plus interesting Cu\u2013Ni\u2013(PGE) mineralization which may have economic potential. This paper, reports new whole-rock major and trace element compositions, PGE abundances and Sr\u2013Nd isotopic data for selected cumulate rocks and basalts. We use these data to investigate the nature of parental magmas and the controls on its evolution from the source mantle en route to the surface involving the Hongge ore-bearing intrusion. Two abrupt changes in Mt/Ilm and trace element ratios such as Ba/Th with depths in the Hongge layered intrusion indicate that this intrusion formed by at least two pluses of relatively primitive magma. The whole rock Sr\u2013Nd isotopic data of basaltic and intrusive rocks plot in the region of Emeishan low-Ti basalts and the compositions of residual liquid (at \u223c1260 \u00b0C and 1155 \u00b0C) calculated by MELTS are similar to our actual high-Ti (BFQ-2) and low-Ti (BC-1) basltic samples, indicate they are co-magmatic rather than derivation from a distinct source. Total PGE abundances in the Hongge samples are extremely low, ranging from 0.5 to 10 ppb. Sulfide-bearing rocks in the Hongge intrusion and the nearby coeval Banfangqing and Baicao basalts have similar mantle-like Pd/Pt ratios (2\u20136) and extremely high Cu/Pd ratios (3 \u00d7 10 to 4 \u00d7 10), indicating that sulfide segregation took place at depth prior to emplacement at Hongge and eruption in this region. Sulfide saturation in the Hongge magma may have resulted from such crustal contamination event. Crystallization of silicate minerals under the anhydrous magma, magma hydration plus Fe\u2013Ti enrichments in the parental magma are three critical factors for the formation of Fe\u2013Ti oxide ore layers in the Hongge intrusion.",

        "abstract": "Details on processes of the early-middle Paleozoic Wuyi\u2013Yunkai orogeny in South China remain poorly defined. Most Silurian\u2013Devonian granites in South China are S-type or I-type granites, which are suggested to be petrogenetically related to the Wuyi\u2013Yunkai orogeny. This paper firstly reported a systematic study on two Devonian A-type granites in the central Jiangxi Province. LA-ICP-MS zircon U\u2013Pb dating results imply that the Huitong and Epo granites were emplaced at about 415 Ma. Both of the two granites have the petrographic and geochemical characteristics of A-type granites. Interstitial biotites occur along the boundary of euhedral plagioclase and quartz and they formed later than plagioclase and quartz. It implies that the primary magma could have been anhydrous. Biotites from the two granites are Fe-rich and have high Fe/(Fe + Mg) ratios (0.60\u20130.74). The magmatic temperatures estimated from zircon saturation thermometer are 802\u2013920 \u00b0C for the two granites, higher than common I-type and S-type granites. The two granites show high contents of total alkalis (NaO + KO = 6.96\u20139.39 wt.%), high field strength elements (e.g. Zr = 181\u2013437 ppm, Y = 22.1\u201339.7 ppm, Nb = 18.6\u201330.3 ppm and Zr + Nb + Ce + Y = 324\u2013555 ppm), rare earth elements (total REE = 155\u2013312 ppm) as well as high Ga/Al ratios (10,000 \u00d7 Ga/Al = 2.50\u20133.44). These geochemical characteristics are similar to those of A-type granites. The Huitong and Epo granites have relatively low \u03b5(t) values of \u2212 10.4 to \u2212 7.7, and low zircon \u03b5(t) values (peak value of \u2212 8.0). Whole-rock two stage Nd isotopic model ages and zircon Hf isotopic model ages mostly vary from 1.78 Ga to 2.00 Ga. According to these data, we suggest that the two granites might have derived from partial melting of pre-Cambrian sedimentary rocks which had been granulitized during an earlier thermal event. The two granites contain abundant contemporaneous mafic microgranular enclaves (MMEs). The MMEs display igneous textures and contain acicular apatites, suggesting quenching of mafic magmas that have co-mingled with the host granites. The MMEs might have derived from the enriched lithospheric mantle source. This study on the Devonian Huitong and Epo A-type granites, together with previous studies on Paleozoic granites in South China, indicated that the Wuyi\u2013Yunkai orogeny in South China had changed from syn-collisional crustal thickening to post-collisional extension at least from 415 Ma.",

        "abstract": "Mafic magmatic enclaves (MMEs) are abundant in Baojishan syn-collisional granitoids located in the eastern section of the North Qilian Orogen. Zircon U-Pb ages of the host granodiorite (433.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4 Ma) and their MMEs (431.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.8 Ma) are the same as the time of the Qilian ocean closing and continental collision at \u223c440\u2013420 Ma, indicating that the granitoids represent a magmatic response to the collision between the Qilian-Qaidam block and the Alashan block. The MMEs have the same mineralogy as the host granodiorite except that they are more abundant in mafic phases (e.g., amphibole and biotite) and thus have higher heavy rare earth element (HREE) abundances. Both the host granodiorite and the MMEs have light REE-enriched patterns and relatively flat HREE patterns (i.e., [Dy/Yb]N\u2009=\u20091\u20131.1). They are enriched in large ion lithophile elements (LILEs; e.g., Rb, K, Pb) and depleted in high field strength elements (HFSEs; e.g., Nb, Ta, Ti) and show a varying Sr anomaly (i.e., Sr/Sr*\u2009=\u20090.9\u20132.2) for the host and a negative Sr anomaly (i.e., Sr/Sr*\u2009=\u20090.4\u20130.6) for the MMEs. Both the host granodiorite and the MMEs have overlapping and indistinguishable Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions (87Sr/86Sr(i)\u2009=\u20090.7067\u20130.7082, \u03b5Nd(t)\u2009=\u2009\u22123.9\u2013\u22123.2, \u03b5Hf(t)\u2009=\u20091.0\u201314.7). The extremely high \u03b5Hf(t)\u2009=\u200914.7 of sample BJS12-06MME likely results from the calculation due to nugget effect of zircons because of the unexpectedly high Hf (3.53 ppm) and too high Zr (128 ppm). All these characteristics are fully consistent with the MMEs being of cumulate origin formed at earlier stages of the same magmatic systems rather than representing mantle melt required by the popular and alleged magma mixing model. The radiogenic Sr and unradiogenic Nd (\u03b5Nd(t) <0) indicate the contribution of mature continental crust, while variably radiogenic Hf (\u03b5Hf(t)\u2009>\u20090) for both the MMEs and their host granodiorite manifest the significant mantle input. The apparent decoupling between Nd and Hf isotopes are likely caused by partial melting of recycled terrigenous sediments and the remaining part of the North Qilian ocean crust under the amphibolite facies conditions during the collision.",
